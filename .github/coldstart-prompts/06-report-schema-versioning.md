# Coldstart Implementation Prompt: Report Schema Versioning

**Priority**: P3
**Repository**: agentready (https://github.com/redhat/agentready)
**Branch Strategy**: Create feature branch from main

---

## Context

You are implementing a feature for AgentReady, a repository quality assessment tool for AI-assisted development.

### Repository Structure
```
agentready/
├── src/agentready/          # Source code
│   ├── models/              # Data models
│   ├── services/            # Scanner orchestration
│   ├── assessors/           # Attribute assessments
│   ├── reporters/           # Report generation (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
│   ├── templates/           # Jinja2 templates
│   └── cli/                 # Click-based CLI
├── tests/                   # Test suite (unit + integration)
├── examples/                # Example reports
└── specs/                   # Feature specifications
```

### Key Technologies
- Python 3.11+
- Click (CLI framework)
- Jinja2 (templating)
- Pytest (testing)
- Black, isort, ruff (code quality)

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b NNN-feature-name`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run linters: `black . && isort . && ruff check .`
4. Run tests: `pytest`
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Create PR to main

## Feature Requirements

Report Schema Versioning

**Priority**: P3 (Important)

**Description**: Define and version the JSON/HTML/Markdown report schemas to ensure backwards compatibility and enable schema evolution.

**Requirements**:
- JSON schema for assessment reports (contracts/assessment-schema.json exists)
- HTML schema for interactive reports (contracts/report-html-schema.md exists)
- Markdown schema for version control reports (contracts/report-markdown-schema.md exists)
- Schema versioning strategy (semantic versioning)
- Backwards compatibility testing
- Schema migration tools for major version changes

**Use Case**:
```bash
# Validate report against schema
agentready validate-report assessment-2025-11-20.json

# Migrate old report to new schema version
agentready migrate-report --from 1.0.0 --to 2.0.0 old-report.json
```

**Related**: Report generation, data model evolution

**Notes**:
- Schemas exist in contracts/ directory but need formal versioning
- Consider using JSON Schema Draft 2020-12
- Tool should validate generated reports against bundled schema
- Breaking schema changes should trigger major version bump

## Implementation Checklist

Before you begin:
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md for project context
- [ ] Review existing similar features (if applicable)
- [ ] Understand the data model (src/agentready/models/)
- [ ] Check acceptance criteria in feature description

Implementation steps:
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Add unit tests (target >80% coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linters and fix any issues
- [ ] Update documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md if needed)
- [ ] Self-test the feature end-to-end
- [ ] Create PR with descriptive title and body

Code quality requirements:
- [ ] All code formatted with black (88 char lines)
- [ ] Imports sorted with isort
- [ ] No ruff violations
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Type hints where appropriate
- [ ] Docstrings for public APIs

## Key Files to Review

Based on this feature, you should review:
- `src/agentready/models/` - Understand Assessment, Finding, Attribute models
- `src/agentready/services/scanner.py` - Scanner orchestration
- `src/agentready/assessors/base.py` - BaseAssessor pattern
- `src/agentready/reporters/` - Report generation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and guidelines
- `BACKLOG.md` - Full context of this feature

---

## Testing Strategy

For this feature, ensure:
1. **Unit tests** for core logic (80%+ coverage)
2. **Integration tests** for end-to-end workflows
3. **Edge case tests** (empty inputs, missing files, errors)
4. **Error handling tests** (graceful degradation)

Run tests:
```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src/agentready --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_feature.py -v
```

---

## Success Criteria

This feature is complete when:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from feature description are met
- ✅ Tests passing with >80% coverage for new code
- ✅ All linters passing (black, isort, ruff)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ PR created with clear description
- ✅ Self-tested end-to-end

---

## Questions to Clarify (if needed)

If anything is unclear during implementation:
1. Check CLAUDE.md for project patterns
2. Review similar existing features
3. Ask for clarification in PR comments
4. Reference the original backlog item
