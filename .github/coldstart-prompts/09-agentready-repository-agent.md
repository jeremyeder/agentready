# Coldstart Implementation Prompt: AgentReady Repository Agent

**Priority**: P3
**Repository**: agentready (https://github.com/redhat/agentready)
**Branch Strategy**: Create feature branch from main

---

## Context

You are implementing a feature for AgentReady, a repository quality assessment tool for AI-assisted development.

### Repository Structure
```
agentready/
├── src/agentready/          # Source code
│   ├── models/              # Data models
│   ├── services/            # Scanner orchestration
│   ├── assessors/           # Attribute assessments
│   ├── reporters/           # Report generation (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
│   ├── templates/           # Jinja2 templates
│   └── cli/                 # Click-based CLI
├── tests/                   # Test suite (unit + integration)
├── examples/                # Example reports
└── specs/                   # Feature specifications
```

### Key Technologies
- Python 3.11+
- Click (CLI framework)
- Jinja2 (templating)
- Pytest (testing)
- Black, isort, ruff (code quality)

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b NNN-feature-name`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run linters: `black . && isort . && ruff check .`
4. Run tests: `pytest`
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Create PR to main

## Feature Requirements

AgentReady Repository Agent

**Priority**: P3 (Important)

**Description**: Create a specialized Claude Code agent for the AgentReady repository to assist with development, testing, and maintenance tasks.

**Requirements**:
- Agent with deep knowledge of AgentReady architecture
- Understands assessment workflow, scoring logic, and report generation
- Can help with:
  - Implementing new assessors
  - Enhancing existing assessors
  - Writing tests for new features
  - Debugging assessment issues
  - Improving report templates
  - Optimizing performance

**Use Case**:
```bash
# In Claude Code, use the agentready-dev agent
/agentready-dev implement new assessor for dependency security scanning
/agentready-dev debug why Python type annotation detection is failing
/agentready-dev optimize assessment performance for large repositories
```

**Features**:
- Pre-loaded context about AgentReady codebase structure
- Knowledge of assessment attributes and scoring algorithm
- Understanding of tier-based weighting system
- Familiar with reporter implementations (HTML, Markdown)
- Can generate new assessors following established patterns

**Implementation**:
- Create `.claude/agents/agentready-dev.md` with agent specification
- Include links to key design documents (data-model.md, plan.md, research.md)
- Provide common development patterns and examples
- Reference test structure and coverage requirements

**Related**: Development workflow, code generation, testing

**Notes**:
- Agent should follow constitution principles (library-first, TDD when requested)
- Should know about stub assessors and how to expand them
- Can help with performance benchmarking and optimization
- Should understand the research report structure and attribute definitions

## Implementation Checklist

Before you begin:
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md for project context
- [ ] Review existing similar features (if applicable)
- [ ] Understand the data model (src/agentready/models/)
- [ ] Check acceptance criteria in feature description

Implementation steps:
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Add unit tests (target >80% coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linters and fix any issues
- [ ] Update documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md if needed)
- [ ] Self-test the feature end-to-end
- [ ] Create PR with descriptive title and body

Code quality requirements:
- [ ] All code formatted with black (88 char lines)
- [ ] Imports sorted with isort
- [ ] No ruff violations
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Type hints where appropriate
- [ ] Docstrings for public APIs

## Key Files to Review

Based on this feature, you should review:
- `src/agentready/models/` - Understand Assessment, Finding, Attribute models
- `src/agentready/services/scanner.py` - Scanner orchestration
- `src/agentready/assessors/base.py` - BaseAssessor pattern
- `src/agentready/reporters/` - Report generation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and guidelines
- `BACKLOG.md` - Full context of this feature

---

## Testing Strategy

For this feature, ensure:
1. **Unit tests** for core logic (80%+ coverage)
2. **Integration tests** for end-to-end workflows
3. **Edge case tests** (empty inputs, missing files, errors)
4. **Error handling tests** (graceful degradation)

Run tests:
```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src/agentready --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_feature.py -v
```

---

## Success Criteria

This feature is complete when:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from feature description are met
- ✅ Tests passing with >80% coverage for new code
- ✅ All linters passing (black, isort, ruff)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ PR created with clear description
- ✅ Self-tested end-to-end

## Questions to Clarify (if needed)

If anything is unclear during implementation:
1. Check CLAUDE.md for project patterns
2. Review similar existing features
3. Ask for clarification in PR comments
4. Reference the original backlog item
