# Coldstart Implementation Prompt: Add Security & Quality Improvements from Code Review

**Priority**: P2
**Repository**: agentready (https://github.com/redhat/agentready)
**Branch Strategy**: Create feature branch from main

---

## Context

You are implementing a feature for AgentReady, a repository quality assessment tool for AI-assisted development.

### Repository Structure
```
agentready/
├── src/agentready/          # Source code
│   ├── models/              # Data models
│   ├── services/            # Scanner orchestration
│   ├── assessors/           # Attribute assessments
│   ├── reporters/           # Report generation (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
│   ├── templates/           # Jinja2 templates
│   └── cli/                 # Click-based CLI
├── tests/                   # Test suite (unit + integration)
├── examples/                # Example reports
└── specs/                   # Feature specifications
```

### Key Technologies
- Python 3.11+
- Click (CLI framework)
- Jinja2 (templating)
- Pytest (testing)
- Black, isort, ruff (code quality)

### Development Workflow
1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b NNN-feature-name`
2. Implement changes with tests
3. Run linters: `black . && isort . && ruff check .`
4. Run tests: `pytest`
5. Commit with conventional commits
6. Create PR to main

## Feature Requirements

Add Security & Quality Improvements from Code Review

**Priority**: P2 (Medium - Polish)

**Description**: Address P2 improvements from code review for better UX and robustness.

**Improvements**:

1. **Input Validation Warnings**
   - Warn when scanning sensitive directories (`/etc`, `/.ssh`, `/var`)
   - Confirm before scanning large repositories (>10k files)

2. **Scorer Semantic Clarity**
   - Document behavior when all attributes skipped (returns 0.0)
   - Consider returning `None` or special value for "not assessable"
   - Add explicit documentation of edge cases

3. **Content Security Policy Headers**
   - Add CSP to HTML reports for defense-in-depth
   - Prevent inline script execution
   - Whitelist only necessary sources

**Implementation**:
```python
# In CLI
sensitive_dirs = ['/etc', '/sys', '/proc', '/.ssh', '/var']
if any(str(repo_path).startswith(p) for p in sensitive_dirs):
    click.confirm(
        f"Warning: Scanning sensitive directory {repo_path}. Continue?",
        abort=True
    )

# In HTMLReporter
csp_header = (
    "<meta http-equiv='Content-Security-Policy' "
    "content=\"default-src 'self'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; "
    "style-src 'unsafe-inline'\">"
)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Warnings for sensitive directories
- [ ] CSP headers in HTML reports
- [ ] Scorer edge cases documented
- [ ] User guide updated with best practices

**Priority Justification**: UX polish and defense-in-depth, not critical bugs.

**Related**: User experience, security hardening

## Implementation Checklist

Before you begin:
- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md for project context
- [ ] Review existing similar features (if applicable)
- [ ] Understand the data model (src/agentready/models/)
- [ ] Check acceptance criteria in feature description

Implementation steps:
- [ ] Create feature branch
- [ ] Implement core functionality
- [ ] Add unit tests (target >80% coverage)
- [ ] Add integration tests (if applicable)
- [ ] Run linters and fix any issues
- [ ] Update documentation (README.md, CLAUDE.md if needed)
- [ ] Self-test the feature end-to-end
- [ ] Create PR with descriptive title and body

Code quality requirements:
- [ ] All code formatted with black (88 char lines)
- [ ] Imports sorted with isort
- [ ] No ruff violations
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Type hints where appropriate
- [ ] Docstrings for public APIs

## Key Files to Review

Based on this feature, you should review:
- `src/agentready/models/` - Understand Assessment, Finding, Attribute models
- `src/agentready/services/scanner.py` - Scanner orchestration
- `src/agentready/assessors/base.py` - BaseAssessor pattern
- `src/agentready/reporters/` - Report generation
- `CLAUDE.md` - Project overview and guidelines
- `BACKLOG.md` - Full context of this feature

---

## Testing Strategy

For this feature, ensure:
1. **Unit tests** for core logic (80%+ coverage)
2. **Integration tests** for end-to-end workflows
3. **Edge case tests** (empty inputs, missing files, errors)
4. **Error handling tests** (graceful degradation)

Run tests:
```bash
# All tests
pytest

# With coverage
pytest --cov=src/agentready --cov-report=html

# Specific test file
pytest tests/unit/test_feature.py -v
```

---

## Success Criteria

This feature is complete when:
- ✅ All acceptance criteria from feature description are met
- ✅ Tests passing with >80% coverage for new code
- ✅ All linters passing (black, isort, ruff)
- ✅ Documentation updated
- ✅ PR created with clear description
- ✅ Self-tested end-to-end

## Questions to Clarify (if needed)

If anything is unclear during implementation:
1. Check CLAUDE.md for project patterns
2. Review similar existing features
3. Ask for clarification in PR comments
4. Reference the original backlog item
