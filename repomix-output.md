## Feature Requirements

Create Automated Demo

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Showcase Value)

**Description**: Create an automated, self-contained demonstration of AgentReady that shows the tool assessing a sample repository, generating reports, and providing remediation guidance. This should be runnable with a single command and suitable for demos, presentations, and onboarding.

**Requirements**:
- Single command to run: `agentready demo`
- Self-contained sample repository (embedded in package or generated on-the-fly)
- Demonstrates full workflow:
  1. Repository analysis
  2. Attribute assessment
  3. Score calculation
  4. HTML/Markdown report generation
  5. Remediation suggestions
- Interactive terminal output showing progress
- Opens generated HTML report automatically in browser
- Reusable for presentations and stakeholder demos

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Run automated demo
agentready demo

# Output:
# 🤖 AgentReady Demo
# ===================
#
# Creating sample repository...
# Analyzing structure...
# Running 25 assessments...
#   ✅ claude_md_file (100/100)
#   ❌ precommit_hooks (0/100)
#   ... [progress indicators]
#
# Assessment complete!
# Score: 67.3/100 (Silver)
#
# Generating reports...
#   📄 demo-report.html (generated)
#   📄 demo-report.md (generated)
#   📄 demo-assessment.json (generated)
#
# Opening HTML report in browser...
```

**Sample Repository Options**:

**Option 1: Embedded Examples** (Ship with package)
```
src/agentready/demo/
├── sample-python-repo/      # Python project (minimal)
│   ├── src/myapp/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── .gitignore
├── sample-js-repo/          # JavaScript project
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── README.md
└── sample-go-repo/          # Go project
```

**Option 2: Generate On-the-Fly** (Dynamic)
```python
def create_demo_repo(tmp_path: Path, language: str = "python") -> Path:
    """Create sample repository for demo."""
    repo = tmp_path / "demo-repo"
    repo.mkdir()

    if language == "python":
        # Create minimal Python project
        create_file(repo / "README.md", "# Demo Project\n\nSample Python project.")
        create_file(repo / "src/main.py", "def main(): pass")
        create_file(repo / ".gitignore", "*.pyc\n__pycache__/")
        # Missing: CLAUDE.md, tests/, pre-commit hooks (intentional for demo)

    return repo
```

**Demo Script Features**:
- **Progress indicators**: Show assessment running in real-time
- **Color-coded output**: Green for pass, red for fail, yellow for warnings
- **Simulated delays**: Add realistic pauses for "dramatic effect" in demos
- **Narration mode**: Optional verbose output explaining each step
- **Screenshot mode**: Generate high-quality terminal screenshots for docs
- **Record mode**: Save terminal session as GIF/video for presentations

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# Demo config embedded in package
demo:
  sample_repo: python  # or javascript, go, minimal
  show_progress: true
  auto_open_browser: true
  output_dir: ./demo-output
  narration: true  # Explain each step
  delay_ms: 500    # Pause between steps for visibility
```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Stakeholder Demo**
```bash
# Quick 2-minute demo for leadership
agentready demo --narration
# Shows: What AgentReady does, how it scores, what reports look like
```

**Use Case 2: Onboarding New Users**
```bash
# Help new users understand the tool
agentready demo --tutorial
# Interactive walkthrough with explanations
```

**Use Case 3: Generate Demo Content for Docs**
```bash
# Create screenshots and videos for documentation
agentready demo --screenshot --record demo.gif
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `agentready demo` runs without any setup
- [ ] Creates sample repository automatically
- [ ] Runs full assessment workflow
- [ ] Generates all report formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
- [ ] Opens HTML report in browser
- [ ] Colorful, engaging terminal output
- [ ] Completes in < 5 seconds
- [ ] No external dependencies required
- [ ] Works offline
- [ ] Includes narration mode for presentations

**Priority Justification**:
- Critical for showcasing tool value to stakeholders
- Needed for Red Hat internal demos and presentations
- Helps with user onboarding and adoption
- Low effort, high impact for visibility
- Required before pitching to other Red Hat teams

**Related**: Onboarding, documentation, marketing

**Notes**:
- Keep demo simple and fast (< 5 seconds)
- Focus on visual impact (colors, progress bars)
- Make it suitable for screenshots/videos
- Consider adding "failure scenario" demo too
- Could expand to multiple language demos
- Add to bootstrap command as part of repo setup

## Feature Requirements

Fix Critical Security & Logic Bugs from Code Review

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Security & Correctness)

**Description**: Address critical bugs discovered in code review that affect security and assessment accuracy.

**Issues to Fix**:

1. **XSS Vulnerability in HTML Reports** (CRITICAL - Security)
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2:579`
   - **Problem**: `assessment_json|safe` disables autoescaping for JSON embedded in JavaScript
   - **Risk**: Repository names, commit messages, file paths from git could contain malicious content
   - **Fix**: Replace with `JSON.parse({{ assessment_json|tojson }})`
   - **Add**: Content Security Policy headers to HTML reports

2. **StandardLayoutAssessor Logic Bug** (CRITICAL - Incorrect Scoring)
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/assessors/structure.py:48`
   - **Problem**: `(repository.path / "tests") or (repository.path / "test")` always evaluates to first path
   - **Impact**: Projects with `test/` instead of `tests/` scored incorrectly
   - **Fix**: Check both paths properly:
     ```python
     tests_path = repository.path / "tests"
     if not tests_path.exists():
         tests_path = repository.path / "test"
     has_tests = tests_path.exists()
     ```

**Implementation**:

**File 1**: `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2`
```jinja2
<!-- BEFORE (VULNERABLE): -->
const ASSESSMENT = {{ assessment_json|safe }};

<!-- AFTER (SECURE): -->
const ASSESSMENT = JSON.parse({{ assessment_json|tojson }});
```

**File 2**: `src/agentready/assessors/structure.py`
```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
standard_dirs = {
    "src": repository.path / "src",
    "tests": (repository.path / "tests") or (repository.path / "test"),  # BUG!
}

# AFTER (CORRECT):
standard_dirs = {
    "src": repository.path / "src",
}

# Check for tests directory (either tests/ or test/)
tests_path = repository.path / "tests"
if not tests_path.exists():
    tests_path = repository.path / "test"
standard_dirs["tests"] = tests_path
```

**Test Cases to Add**:
```python
def test_xss_in_repository_name():
    """Test that malicious repo names are escaped in HTML."""
    repo = Repository(
        name="<script>alert('xss')</script>",
        # ...
    )
    html = HTMLReporter().generate(assessment, output)
    assert "<script>" not in html  # Should be escaped

def test_standard_layout_with_test_dir():
    """Test that 'test/' directory is recognized (not just 'tests/')."""
    # Create repo with test/ directory only
    repo_path = tmp_path / "repo"
    (repo_path / "test").mkdir(parents=True)

    assessor = StandardLayoutAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    assert finding.status == "pass"  # Should recognize test/ dir
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] XSS vulnerability patched with `tojson` filter
- [ ] CSP headers added to HTML reports (future)
- [ ] StandardLayoutAssessor recognizes both `tests/` and `test/`
- [ ] Tests added for XSS prevention
- [ ] Tests added for both test directory naming patterns
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

**Priority Justification**:
- **Security**: XSS is a P0 vulnerability
- **Correctness**: Incorrect scoring undermines tool credibility
- **Quick fixes**: Both are 5-10 minute changes

**Related**: Issue #2 (Report improvements), Bootstrap (#1 - needs secure reports)

## Feature Requirements

Bootstrap AgentReady Repository on GitHub

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Dogfooding)

**Description**: Implement `agentready bootstrap` command to set up the agentready repository itself on GitHub with all best practices. This is the FIRST feature to implement - we'll dogfood our own tool!

**Vision**: Use AgentReady to bootstrap the AgentReady repository - demonstrating the tool's value while setting up our own infrastructure.

**Why P0**:
- Demonstrates tool value immediately (dogfooding)
- Sets up critical GitHub infrastructure (Actions, badges, PR templates)
- Validates bootstrap command design before external users
- Creates the foundation for GitHub App integration

**Requirements**:

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create/update repository on GitHub via `gh` CLI
   - Set repository description and topics
   - Configure repository settings (PR requirements, branch protection)

              repo: context.repo.repo,
              body: report
            });
```

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1: Core Bootstrap** (This Sprint)
- Implement `agentready bootstrap` command
- Create template files for GitHub Actions, pre-commit, templates
- Test on agentready repository itself
- Commit all generated files

**Phase 2: GitHub Integration** (Next Sprint)
- Use `gh` CLI to create/update repository
- Set up branch protection rules
- Configure repository settings
- Add repository badges

**Phase 3: Language-Specific Templates** (Future)
- Python-specific templates (pytest, black, mypy)
- JavaScript-specific (eslint, prettier, jest)
- Go-specific (golangci-lint, gotestsum)

**Files to Create**:

```
src/agentready/
├── cli/bootstrap.py           # Bootstrap CLI command
├── bootstrap/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── generator.py          # File generator

```

**Acceptance Criteria**:

- [ ] `agentready bootstrap .` creates all required files
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows are valid and functional
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks install and run successfully
- [ ] Repository badges added to README.md
- [ ] Dry-run mode shows what would be created
- [ ] Interactive mode prompts for confirmation
- [ ] Successfully bootstrap agentready repository itself
- [ ] All generated files committed to agentready repo
- [ ] GitHub Actions runs assessment on every PR

**Success Metrics**:

- AgentReady repository on GitHub has:
  - ✅ GitHub Actions running assessments
  - ✅ PR template with checklist
  - ✅ Issue templates for bugs/features
  - ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured
  - ✅ Dependabot enabled
  - ✅ Repository badge showing score
  - ✅ All linters passing in CI

**Priority Justification**:

This is P0 because:
1. **Dogfooding** - We need this for our own repository first
2. **Demonstrates value** - Shows AgentReady in action on itself
3. **Foundation** - Required before GitHub App integration
4. **Credibility** - Can't tell others to use it if we don't use it ourselves

**Related**: GitHub App Integration (#5), Align Command (#3)

**Notes**:
- Start with Python-specific templates (our use case)
- Keep templates simple and focused
- Use Jinja2 for template rendering
- Integrate with `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- All templates should pass AgentReady assessment!

## Feature Requirements

Report Header with Repository Metadata

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Blocking Usability)

**Description**: Add prominent report header showing what repository/agent/code was scanned. Currently reports lack context about what was assessed.

**Problem**: Users cannot identify what the report is about without digging into the details. No repository name, path, timestamp, or assessment context visible at the top.

**Requirements**:
- **Prominent header section** at the top of all report formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
- Repository name (bold, large font)
- Repository path (absolute path on filesystem or GitHub URL)
- Assessment timestamp (human-readable: "November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM")
- Branch name and commit hash
- AgentReady version used for assessment
- Who ran the assessment (username@hostname)
- Command used: `agentready assess /path/to/repo --verbose`

**HTML Report Header Design**:
```html
<header class="report-header">
  <div class="repo-info">
    <h1>AgentReady Assessment Report</h1>
    <div class="repo-name">Repository: agentready</div>
    <div class="repo-path">/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready</div>
    <div class="repo-git">Branch: 001-agentready-scorer | Commit: d49947c</div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta-info">
    <div>Assessed: November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM</div>
    <div>AgentReady Version: 1.0.0</div>
    <div>Run by: jeder@macbook</div>
  </div>
</header>
```

**Markdown Report Header**:
```markdown
# 🤖 AgentReady Assessment Report

**Repository**: agentready
**Path**: `/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready`
**Branch**: `001-agentready-scorer` | **Commit**: `d49947c`
**Assessed**: November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM
**AgentReady Version**: 1.0.0
**Run by**: jeder@macbook

---
```

**JSON Report Metadata**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "agentready_version": "1.0.0",
    "assessment_timestamp": "2025-11-21T02:11:05Z",
    "assessment_timestamp_human": "November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM",
    "executed_by": "jeder@macbook",
    "command": "agentready assess . --verbose",
    "working_directory": "/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready"
  },
  "repository": { ... }
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Add metadata collection to Scanner
- Update all reporter templates (HTML, Markdown)
- Enhance Assessment model with metadata field
- Position header prominently (before score summary)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ User can immediately identify what repository was assessed
- ✅ Timestamp shows when assessment was run
- ✅ Git context (branch, commit) visible
- ✅ AgentReady version tracked for reproducibility

**Related**: Report generation, usability, debugging

**Notes**:
- This is blocking adoption - users confused about report context
- Critical for multi-repository workflows
- Needed for CI/CD integration (track which build)

## Feature Requirements

Improve HTML Report Design (Font Size & Color Scheme)

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Poor User Experience)

**Description**: Completely redesign HTML report color scheme and increase all font sizes by at least 4 points for readability.

**Problems**:
1. **Color scheme is "hideous"** (user feedback) - current purple gradient doesn't work
2. **Font sizes too small** - hard to read on modern displays
3. **Poor contrast** - some text hard to distinguish

**New Color Scheme** (Dark/Professional):
```css
:root {
  /* Base colors - mostly black, dark blue, purple, white */
  --background: #0a0e27;           /* Almost black with blue tint */
  --surface: #1a1f3a;              /* Dark blue surface */
  --surface-elevated: #252b4a;     /* Slightly lighter surface */

  /* Primary colors */
  --primary: #8b5cf6;              /* Purple (accent) */
  --primary-light: #a78bfa;        /* Light purple */
  --primary-dark: #6d28d9;         /* Dark purple */

  /* Text colors */
  --text-primary: #f8fafc;         /* Almost white */
  --text-secondary: #cbd5e1;       /* Light gray */
  --text-muted: #94a3b8;           /* Muted gray */

  /* Status colors */
  --success: #10b981;              /* Green (pass) */
  --warning: #f59e0b;              /* Amber (warning) */
  --danger: #ef4444;               /* Red (fail) */
  --neutral: #64748b;              /* Gray (skipped) */

  /* UI elements */
  --border: #334155;               /* Dark border */
  --shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);   /* Deep shadows */
}
```

**Font Size Increases** (+4pt minimum):
```css
/* Current → New */
body { font-size: 14px → 18px; }
h1 { font-size: 28px → 36px; }
h2 { font-size: 24px → 30px; }
h3 { font-size: 20px → 26px; }
.score { font-size: 48px → 56px; }
.attribute-name { font-size: 16px → 22px; }
.evidence { font-size: 13px → 17px; }
code { font-size: 13px → 16px; }
```

**Design Mockup**:
```

│ [Dark navy blue background #1a1f3a]                │
│                                                     │

│           75.4 / 100                               │
│           [56px, bold, white]                      │
│           🥇 Gold                                   │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Checklist**:
- [ ] Replace gradient backgrounds with dark blue/black
- [ ] Update all font sizes (+4pt minimum)
- [ ] Use purple (#8b5cf6) sparingly as accent color
- [ ] Ensure white text on dark backgrounds (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Update certification level colors
- [ ] Redesign score cards with new scheme
- [ ] Test with colorblind simulators
- [ ] Add light mode as alternative (with same professional palette)

**Before/After Color Comparison**:
```
Current (Problems):
- Purple gradient everywhere: #667eea → #764ba2 ❌
- Small text: 14px base ❌
- Busy, overwhelming ❌

New (Professional):
- Dark blue/black base: #0a0e27, #1a1f3a ✅
- Purple accents only: #8b5cf6 ✅
- Large text: 18px base ✅
- Clean, readable ✅
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All text easily readable (18px minimum body text)
- ✅ Color scheme uses black, dark blue, purple, white palette
- ✅ High contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- ✅ Professional appearance suitable for Red Hat engineering
- ✅ Purple used as accent, not dominant color

**Related**: HTML report generation, UX, accessibility

**Notes**:
- Current design blocks user adoption (visual issues)
- This is the first thing users see - must be excellent
- Consider adding screenshot to docs after redesign
- Font size critical for presentations and stakeholder reviews

## Feature Requirements

Report Schema Versioning

**Priority**: P3 (Important)

**Description**: Define and version the JSON/HTML/Markdown report schemas to ensure backwards compatibility and enable schema evolution.

**Requirements**:
- JSON schema for assessment reports (contracts/assessment-schema.json exists)
- HTML schema for interactive reports (contracts/report-html-schema.md exists)
- Markdown schema for version control reports (contracts/report-markdown-schema.md exists)
- Schema versioning strategy (semantic versioning)
- Backwards compatibility testing
- Schema migration tools for major version changes

**Use Case**:
```bash
# Validate report against schema
agentready validate-report assessment-2025-11-20.json

# Migrate old report to new schema version
agentready migrate-report --from 1.0.0 --to 2.0.0 old-report.json
```

**Related**: Report generation, data model evolution

**Notes**:
- Schemas exist in contracts/ directory but need formal versioning
- Consider using JSON Schema Draft 2020-12
- Tool should validate generated reports against bundled schema
- Breaking schema changes should trigger major version bump

- JavaScript theme switcher in HTML report (no page reload)
- Theme loader in HTMLReporter
- Validate theme configurations
- Preserve accessibility in all themes (WCAG 2.1 AA)
- Add theme preview command: `agentready theme-preview dark`
- Embed all theme CSS in single HTML file (offline-capable)

**Related**: HTML report generation, user experience

**Notes**:
- All themes must maintain WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios
- Dark mode should invert appropriately, not just be dark
- Consider colorblind-friendly palettes (Viridis, ColorBrewer)
- Custom themes should be shareable (export/import)
- Could add theme gallery in documentation

## Feature Requirements

Fix Code Quality Issues from Code Review

**Priority**: P1 (High - Quality & Reliability)

**Description**: Address P1 issues discovered in code review that affect reliability, accuracy, and code quality.

**Issues to Fix**:

1. **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) in File Operations**
   - **Location**: Multiple assessors (`documentation.py:46-50`, `documentation.py:174-191`)
   - **Problem**: Check if file exists, then read in separate operation - file could be deleted in between
   - **Impact**: Crashes instead of graceful degradation
   - **Fix**: Use try-except around file reads instead of existence checks
   ```python
   # BEFORE:
   if claude_md_path.exists():
       size = claude_md_path.stat().st_size

   # AFTER:
   try:
       with open(claude_md_path, "r") as f:
           size = len(f.read())
   except FileNotFoundError:
       return Finding(...status="fail"...)
   except OSError as e:
       return Finding.error(self.attribute, f"Could not read: {e}")
   ```

2. **Inaccurate Type Annotation Detection**
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/assessors/code_quality.py:98-102`
   - **Problem**: Regex-based detection has false positives (string literals, dict literals)
   - **Impact**: Inflated type annotation coverage scores
   - **Fix**: Use AST parsing instead of regex:
   ```python
   import ast
   tree = ast.parse(content)
   for node in ast.walk(tree):
       if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
           total_functions += 1
           has_annotations = (node.returns is not None or
                            any(arg.annotation for arg in node.args.args))
           if has_annotations:
               typed_functions += 1
   ```

3. **Assessment Validation Semantic Confusion**
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/models/assessment.py:54-59`
   - **Problem**: Field named `attributes_skipped` but includes `error` and `not_applicable` statuses
   - **Impact**: Confusing API, unclear semantics
   - **Fix**: Rename to `attributes_not_assessed` OR add separate counters

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All file operations use try-except pattern
- [ ] Type annotation detection uses AST parsing
- [ ] Assessment model fields clearly named
- [ ] Tests added for TOCTOU edge cases
- [ ] Tests added for type annotation false positives
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Priority Justification**: These affect reliability and measurement accuracy - critical for a quality assessment tool.

**Related**: Testing improvements, code quality

## Feature Requirements

Improve Test Coverage and Edge Case Handling

**Priority**: P1 (High - Quality Assurance)

**Description**: Increase test coverage from 37% to >80% and add tests for critical edge cases discovered in code review.

**Critical Test Gaps**:

1. **Error Handling Paths** (Currently 0% coverage)
   - OSError, PermissionError in file operations
   - MissingToolError in assessors
   - Invalid repository paths
   - Malformed git repositories

2. **Edge Cases** (No tests)
   - Empty repositories
   - Binary files instead of text
   - Symlinks in repository
   - Very large repositories (>10k files)
   - Repositories with `test/` vs `tests/` directories

3. **Security Test Cases**
   - XSS in repository names, commit messages
   - Path traversal attempts
   - Malicious file names

4. **Scorer Edge Cases**
   - All attributes skipped (score should be 0.0)
   - Config weights don't sum to 1.0
   - Division by zero scenarios

**Implementation**:
```python
# tests/unit/test_edge_cases.py
def test_empty_repository(tmp_path):
    """Test assessment of completely empty repository."""
    # Create empty git repo
    repo = Repository(path=tmp_path, ...)
    scanner = Scanner(repo, config=None)
    assessment = scanner.scan(assessors)
    # Should not crash, should have valid score
    assert 0.0 <= assessment.overall_score <= 100.0

def test_permission_denied_file(tmp_path):
    """Test graceful handling of permission errors."""
    # Create unreadable file
    restricted = tmp_path / "CLAUDE.md"
    restricted.write_text("test")
    restricted.chmod(0o000)

    assessor = CLAUDEmdAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    assert finding.status == "error"
    assert "permission" in finding.error_message.lower()

def test_binary_file_as_readme(tmp_path):
    """Test handling of binary files."""
    readme = tmp_path / "README.md"
    readme.write_bytes(b"\x00\x01\x02\x03")

    assessor = READMEAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    # Should not crash
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test coverage increased to >80%
- [ ] All error handling paths tested
- [ ] Edge cases for empty/malformed repos covered
- [ ] Security test cases added
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] CI runs coverage report and fails <75%

**Priority Justification**: Quality assessment tool must be thoroughly tested. Current 37% coverage is unacceptable.

**Related**: CI/CD improvements, reliability

## Feature Requirements

Add Security & Quality Improvements from Code Review

**Priority**: P2 (Medium - Polish)

**Description**: Address P2 improvements from code review for better UX and robustness.

**Improvements**:

1. **Input Validation Warnings**
   - Warn when scanning sensitive directories (`/etc`, `/.ssh`, `/var`)
   - Confirm before scanning large repositories (>10k files)

2. **Scorer Semantic Clarity**
   - Document behavior when all attributes skipped (returns 0.0)
   - Consider returning `None` or special value for "not assessable"
   - Add explicit documentation of edge cases

3. **Content Security Policy Headers**
   - Add CSP to HTML reports for defense-in-depth
   - Prevent inline script execution
   - Whitelist only necessary sources

**Implementation**:
```python
# In CLI
sensitive_dirs = ['/etc', '/sys', '/proc', '/.ssh', '/var']
if any(str(repo_path).startswith(p) for p in sensitive_dirs):
    click.confirm(
        f"Warning: Scanning sensitive directory {repo_path}. Continue?",
        abort=True
    )

# In HTMLReporter
csp_header = (
    "<meta http-equiv='Content-Security-Policy' "
    "content=\"default-src 'self'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; "
    "style-src 'unsafe-inline'\">"
)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Warnings for sensitive directories
- [ ] CSP headers in HTML reports
- [ ] Scorer edge cases documented
- [ ] User guide updated with best practices

**Priority Justification**: UX polish and defense-in-depth, not critical bugs.

**Related**: User experience, security hardening

**Vision**: One command to align your repository with best practices - automatically create missing files, configure tooling, and improve code quality.

**Core Command**:

```bash
# Align repository to best practices
agentready align .

# Preview changes without applying
agentready align . --dry-run

# Apply specific attributes only
agentready align . --attributes claude_md_file,precommit_hooks

# Create GitHub PR instead of direct changes
agentready align . --create-pr

# Interactive mode (confirm each change)
agentready align . --interactive
```

- **Dry-run by default** for destructive operations
- **Git worktree** for isolated changes (optional)
- **Backup creation** before modifying files
- **Rollback support** if fixes fail
- **Validation** of generated files before writing
- **Interactive confirmation** for AI-powered fixes

**Related**: Automated remediation, repository improvement, onboarding

**Notes**:
- Start with template-based fixes (highest ROI, lowest risk)
- AI-powered fixes require API key and user consent
- Some attributes cannot be automatically fixed (requires human judgment)
- Consider integration with `git stash` for safety
- Could generate shell script of changes for manual review
- Align with Red Hat's AI-assisted development workflow

## Feature Requirements

Interactive Dashboard with Automated Remediation

**Priority**: P2 (High Value)

**Description**: Transform the static HTML report into an interactive dashboard that enables one-click remediation via automated GitHub issue creation and draft PR generation.

**Vision**: "How to Align Your Repo with Best Practices" - Click a button → Open GitHub issue with draft PR containing fixes.

**Core Features**:

1. **Interactive Dashboard Mode**
   - Real-time assessment (WebSocket updates)
   - Live filtering and sorting (already have this)
   - Action buttons on each failing attribute
   - Progress tracking across multiple runs
   - Historical trend visualization

2. **One-Click Remediation Actions**
   - "Fix This" button on each failing attribute
   - Generates GitHub issue automatically
   - Creates draft PR with proposed changes
   - Links issue to PR
   - Assigns to repository owner/team

3. **Automated Fix Generation**
   - Template-based fixes for common issues:
     - Missing .gitignore → Generate language-specific .gitignore
     - No CLAUDE.md → Generate template with repo analysis
     - Missing pre-commit hooks → Add .pre-commit-config.yaml
     - No lock files → Generate appropriate lock file
     - Missing README sections → Scaffold missing sections
   - AI-powered fixes for complex issues:
     - Refactor high-complexity functions
     - Add type annotations to functions
     - Generate docstrings from function signatures
     - Split large files

4. **GitHub Integration**
   - OAuth authentication with GitHub
   - gh CLI integration for seamless workflow
   - Create issues via GitHub API
   - Create draft PRs via GitHub API
   - Auto-label issues (e.g., `agentready`, `automated-fix`, `tier-1-essential`)
   - Link to AgentReady assessment report

**Technical Architecture**:

```yaml
# New components needed:

Backend (Optional - could be fully client-side with gh CLI):
  - GitHub OAuth app for authentication
  - Issue/PR template generator
  - Fix generator service (template-based + AI-powered)
  - Assessment history tracker

Frontend (Enhanced HTML report):
  - Action buttons with loading states
  - GitHub auth flow UI
  - Progress indicators
  - Toast notifications for actions
  - Modal dialogs for fix preview

CLI Extensions:
  - agentready dashboard .  # Launch local web server
  - agentready fix <attribute-id>  # Generate fix for specific attribute
  - agentready create-issue <attribute-id>  # Create GitHub issue
  - agentready create-pr <attribute-id>  # Create draft PR
```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Quick Fixes**
```bash
# User runs assessment
agentready assess . --dashboard

# Opens dashboard in browser at http://localhost:8000
# User clicks "Fix This" on "Missing CLAUDE.md"
# → Creates issue: "Add CLAUDE.md configuration file"
# → Creates draft PR with generated CLAUDE.md template
# → PR includes: project analysis, detected languages, suggested structure
```

**Use Case 2: Batch Remediation**
```bash
# Dashboard shows all failures
# User selects multiple attributes
# Clicks "Fix All Selected"
# → Creates single issue: "Improve AgentReady Score from Silver to Gold"
# → Creates draft PR with all fixes
# → PR description includes before/after score projection
```

**Use Case 3: CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# GitHub Action runs assessment
# Posts comment on PR with assessment results
# Includes links to create remediation issues
# Can auto-create draft PR for improvements
```

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Client-Side with gh CLI** (Simplest, no backend needed)
- Use JavaScript in HTML report to call gh CLI via local proxy
- Generate fix files locally
- Use `gh issue create` and `gh pr create`
- Works for users with gh CLI installed

**Phase 2: Dashboard Server** (Enhanced UX)
- Flask/FastAPI server serving dashboard
- WebSocket for live updates
- GitHub OAuth for authentication
- Background workers for fix generation

**Phase 3: Cloud Service** (SaaS offering)
- Hosted dashboard at agentready.dev
- GitHub App installation
- Webhook integration for continuous monitoring
- Team collaboration features

**Fix Templates by Attribute**:

```yaml
claude_md_file:
  type: template
  generates:
    - file: CLAUDE.md
      content: |
        # {repository_name}

        ## Overview
        {auto_generated_description}

        ## Architecture
        {detected_patterns}

        ## Development
        {build_commands}

lock_files:
  type: command
  commands:
    - condition: has_package_json
      run: npm install
    - condition: has_pyproject_toml
      run: poetry lock || pip freeze > requirements.txt

precommit_hooks:
  type: template
  generates:
    - file: .pre-commit-config.yaml
      content: {language_specific_hooks}

readme_structure:
  type: enhancement
  modifies: README.md
  adds_sections:
    - Installation
    - Usage
    - Development
    - Contributing

type_annotations:
  type: ai_powered
  uses: ast_analysis + llm
  modifies: "*.py"
  adds: type_hints
```

**Dashboard vs Report Decision**:

**Keep Both**:
- Static reports for CI/CD, documentation, archiving
- Dashboard for interactive development workflow
- Reports can link to dashboard for remediation
- Dashboard can export static reports

**Benefits of Dashboard**:
- ✅ Interactive remediation workflow
- ✅ Live assessment updates
- ✅ Progress tracking over time
- ✅ Team collaboration (comments, assignments)
- ✅ Automated fix preview before applying
- ✅ Integration with existing tools (GitHub, IDEs)

**Challenges**:
- Authentication complexity (GitHub OAuth)
- Fix generation quality (need good templates + AI)
- PR review overhead (lots of automated PRs)
- Maintaining fix templates as best practices evolve

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **Start with enhanced static report**:
   - Add "Create Issue" buttons that generate gh CLI commands
   - Users copy/paste commands to create issues
   - Include fix templates in issue descriptions

2. **Add local dashboard** (Phase 2):
   - Flask server with WebSocket updates
   - GitHub integration via gh CLI
   - Generate fixes, preview diffs, create PRs

3. **Consider hosted service** (Phase 3+):
   - If adoption is high
   - SaaS model for teams
   - Continuous monitoring and recommendations

**Related**: GitHub integration, automation, remediation, UX

**Notes**:
- This is a MAJOR feature that could become a standalone product
- Consider MVP: "Copy this gh command" buttons in HTML report
- AI-powered fix generation requires careful validation
- Some fixes (like refactoring) need human review
- Could integrate with existing tools (Dependabot, Renovate)
- May want to partner with GitHub for official integration

## Feature Requirements

GitHub App Integration (Badge & Status Checks)

**Priority**: P2 (High Value)

**Description**: Create a GitHub App that provides badge integration, PR status checks, and automated assessment comments to help Red Hat engineering teams track and improve repository quality.

**Core Features**:

1. **Repository Badge**
   - Shields.io-compatible SVG badge showing certification level
   - Endpoint: `https://agentready.redhat.com/badge/{owner}/{repo}.svg`
   - Dynamic color based on certification (Platinum=purple, Gold=yellow, Silver=silver, Bronze=brown)
   - Include score: "AgentReady: 85.2 (Gold)"
   - Click badge to view latest assessment report

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Create official `agentready/assess-action` GitHub Action
   - Run assessment on PR events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
   - Run assessment on push to main/master
   - Support custom triggers via workflow_dispatch

3. **PR Status Checks**
   - Use GitHub Commit Status API to report assessment results
   - Set check status: success (>90), warning (75-89), failure (<75)
   - Configurable thresholds via `.agentready-config.yaml`
   - Block PR merge if score below threshold (optional)
   - Link to detailed HTML report in check details

4. **PR Comments**
   - Automated bot comments on PRs with assessment summary
   - Show score delta: "Score changed: 72.4 → 78.3 (+5.9)"
   - List new failures and fixes
   - Collapsible sections for full findings
   - Trend chart showing last 10 assessments (ASCII or embedded image)
   - Include remediation suggestions for new failures

**Technical Implementation**:

**Phase 1: GitHub Actions Integration**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/agentready.yml
name: AgentReady Assessment
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  assess:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: agentready/assess-action@v1
        with:
          threshold: 75
          post-comment: true
          update-status: true
```

**Phase 2: Badge Service**
```python
# FastAPI endpoint for badge generation
@app.get("/badge/{owner}/{repo}.svg")
async def get_badge(owner: str, repo: str):
    # Fetch latest assessment from GitHub Actions artifacts
    # Or run quick assessment on-demand
    score, level = get_latest_assessment(owner, repo)
    color = LEVEL_COLORS[level]
    return SVGResponse(generate_badge(score, level, color))
```

**Phase 3: GitHub App**
- App permissions: Contents (read), Checks (write), Pull requests (write)
- Webhook events: push, pull_request
- Installed via GitHub Marketplace (Red Hat internal)
- Dashboard at agentready.redhat.com showing:
  - Repository list with scores
  - Historical trends
  - Organization-wide statistics
  - Top repositories by improvement

**Integration Points**:

1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**
   - Store assessment reports as workflow artifacts
   - Keep last 30 days of reports for trend analysis
   - Generate downloadable HTML/JSON/Markdown reports

2. **GitHub Status API**
   ```python
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{commit_sha}
   {
     "state": "success",  # or "pending", "failure", "error"
     "target_url": "https://agentready.redhat.com/reports/{run_id}",
     "description": "AgentReady: 85.2 (Gold)",
     "context": "agentready/assessment"
   }
   ```

3. **GitHub Checks API** (preferred over Status API)
   ```python
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs
   {
     "name": "AgentReady Assessment",
     "status": "completed",
     "conclusion": "success",
     "output": {
       "title": "Score: 85.2/100 (Gold)",
       "summary": "Passed 20/25 attributes",
       "text": "Detailed findings..."
     }
   }
   ```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Add Badge to README**
```markdown
# My Project

[![AgentReady](https://agentready.redhat.com/badge/redhat/my-project.svg)](https://agentready.redhat.com/reports/redhat/my-project)
```

**Use Case 2: Enforce Quality Gates**
```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml
github:
  status_checks:
    enabled: true
    min_score: 75  # Block merge if score < 75
    require_improvement: true  # Block if score decreased
```

**Use Case 3: Track Organization Progress**
- Dashboard shows all repos in Red Hat org
- Filter by team, language, certification level
- Identify repos needing attention
- Celebrate improvements (score increases)

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml
github:
  badge:
    enabled: true
    style: flat-square  # or flat, plastic, for-the-badge
    label: "AgentReady"

  actions:
    enabled: true
    trigger_on: [pull_request, push]
    post_comment: true
    update_status: true
    upload_artifacts: true

  status_checks:
    enabled: true
    min_score: 75
    require_improvement: false

  comments:
    enabled: true
    show_delta: true
    show_trend: true
    collapse_details: true
```

**Implementation Checklist**:

- [ ] Create `agentready/assess-action` GitHub Action
- [ ] Implement badge generation service
- [ ] Add GitHub Status API integration
- [ ] Add GitHub Checks API integration
- [ ] Implement PR comment generation
- [ ] Add score delta calculation
- [ ] Create assessment artifact storage
- [ ] Build organization dashboard
- [ ] Add Red Hat SSO authentication
- [ ] Deploy to Red Hat infrastructure
- [ ] Create documentation for Red Hat teams
- [ ] Add to Red Hat developer onboarding

**Related**: CI/CD integration, automation, visibility, quality gates

**Notes**:
- Focus on internal Red Hat adoption first
- Badge service could be hosted on Red Hat infrastructure
- Dashboard should integrate with Red Hat IdM for authentication
- Consider integration with Red Hat's existing code quality tools
- GitHub App should be installable via Red Hat GitHub Enterprise
- All data stays within Red Hat infrastructure (no external services)
- Align with Red Hat's OpenShift AI strategy for agentic development
- Could become part of Red Hat's AI-assisted development workflow

description: Perform a non-destructive cross-artifact consistency and quality analysis across spec.md, plan.md, and tasks.md after task generation.
---

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Goal

Identify inconsistencies, duplications, ambiguities, and underspecified items across the three core artifacts (`spec.md`, `plan.md`, `tasks.md`) before implementation. This command MUST run only after `/speckit.tasks` has successfully produced a complete `tasks.md`.

## Operating Constraints

**STRICTLY READ-ONLY**: Do **not** modify any files. Output a structured analysis report. Offer an optional remediation plan (user must explicitly approve before any follow-up editing commands would be invoked manually).

**Constitution Authority**: The project constitution (`.specify/memory/constitution.md`) is **non-negotiable** within this analysis scope. Constitution conflicts are automatically CRITICAL and require adjustment of the spec, plan, or tasks—not dilution, reinterpretation, or silent ignoring of the principle. If a principle itself needs to change, that must occur in a separate, explicit constitution update outside `/speckit.analyze`.

## Execution Steps

### 1. Initialize Analysis Context

Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` once from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS. Derive absolute paths:

- SPEC = FEATURE_DIR/spec.md
- PLAN = FEATURE_DIR/plan.md
- TASKS = FEATURE_DIR/tasks.md

Abort with an error message if any required file is missing (instruct the user to run missing prerequisite command).
For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

### 2. Load Artifacts (Progressive Disclosure)

Load only the minimal necessary context from each artifact:

**From spec.md:**

- Overview/Context
- Functional Requirements
- Non-Functional Requirements
- User Stories
- Edge Cases (if present)

**From plan.md:**

- Architecture/stack choices
- Data Model references
- Phases
- Technical constraints

**From tasks.md:**

- Task IDs
- Descriptions
- Phase grouping
- Parallel markers [P]
- Referenced file paths

**From constitution:**

- Load `.specify/memory/constitution.md` for principle validation

### 3. Build Semantic Models

Create internal representations (do not include raw artifacts in output):

- **Requirements inventory**: Each functional + non-functional requirement with a stable key (derive slug based on imperative phrase; e.g., "User can upload file" → `user-can-upload-file`)
- **User story/action inventory**: Discrete user actions with acceptance criteria
- **Task coverage mapping**: Map each task to one or more requirements or stories (inference by keyword / explicit reference patterns like IDs or key phrases)
- **Constitution rule set**: Extract principle names and MUST/SHOULD normative statements

### 4. Detection Passes (Token-Efficient Analysis)

Focus on high-signal findings. Limit to 50 findings total; aggregate remainder in overflow summary.

#### A. Duplication Detection

- Identify near-duplicate requirements
- Mark lower-quality phrasing for consolidation

#### B. Ambiguity Detection

- Flag vague adjectives (fast, scalable, secure, intuitive, robust) lacking measurable criteria
- Flag unresolved placeholders (TODO, TKTK, ???, `<placeholder>`, etc.)

#### C. Underspecification

- Requirements with verbs but missing object or measurable outcome
- User stories missing acceptance criteria alignment
- Tasks referencing files or components not defined in spec/plan

#### D. Constitution Alignment

- Any requirement or plan element conflicting with a MUST principle
- Missing mandated sections or quality gates from constitution

#### E. Coverage Gaps

- Requirements with zero associated tasks
- Tasks with no mapped requirement/story
- Non-functional requirements not reflected in tasks (e.g., performance, security)

#### F. Inconsistency

- Terminology drift (same concept named differently across files)
- Data entities referenced in plan but absent in spec (or vice versa)
- Task ordering contradictions (e.g., integration tasks before foundational setup tasks without dependency note)
- Conflicting requirements (e.g., one requires Next.js while other specifies Vue)

### 5. Severity Assignment

Use this heuristic to prioritize findings:

- **CRITICAL**: Violates constitution MUST, missing core spec artifact, or requirement with zero coverage that blocks baseline functionality
- **HIGH**: Duplicate or conflicting requirement, ambiguous security/performance attribute, untestable acceptance criterion
- **MEDIUM**: Terminology drift, missing non-functional task coverage, underspecified edge case
- **LOW**: Style/wording improvements, minor redundancy not affecting execution order

### 6. Produce Compact Analysis Report

Output a Markdown report (no file writes) with the following structure:

## Specification Analysis Report

| ID | Category | Severity | Location(s) | Summary | Recommendation |
|----|----------|----------|-------------|---------|----------------|
| A1 | Duplication | HIGH | spec.md:L120-134 | Two similar requirements ... | Merge phrasing; keep clearer version |

(Add one row per finding; generate stable IDs prefixed by category initial.)

**Coverage Summary Table:**

| Requirement Key | Has Task? | Task IDs | Notes |
|-----------------|-----------|----------|-------|

**Constitution Alignment Issues:** (if any)

**Unmapped Tasks:** (if any)

**Metrics:**

- Total Requirements
- Total Tasks
- Coverage % (requirements with >=1 task)
- Ambiguity Count
- Duplication Count
- Critical Issues Count

### 7. Provide Next Actions

At end of report, output a concise Next Actions block:

- If CRITICAL issues exist: Recommend resolving before `/speckit.implement`
- If only LOW/MEDIUM: User may proceed, but provide improvement suggestions
- Provide explicit command suggestions: e.g., "Run /speckit.specify with refinement", "Run /speckit.plan to adjust architecture", "Manually edit tasks.md to add coverage for 'performance-metrics'"

### 8. Offer Remediation

Ask the user: "Would you like me to suggest concrete remediation edits for the top N issues?" (Do NOT apply them automatically.)

## Operating Principles

### Context Efficiency

- **Minimal high-signal tokens**: Focus on actionable findings, not exhaustive documentation
- **Progressive disclosure**: Load artifacts incrementally; don't dump all content into analysis
- **Token-efficient output**: Limit findings table to 50 rows; summarize overflow
- **Deterministic results**: Rerunning without changes should produce consistent IDs and counts

### Analysis Guidelines

- **NEVER modify files** (this is read-only analysis)
- **NEVER hallucinate missing sections** (if absent, report them accurately)
- **Prioritize constitution violations** (these are always CRITICAL)
- **Use examples over exhaustive rules** (cite specific instances, not generic patterns)
- **Report zero issues gracefully** (emit success report with coverage statistics)

## File: .claude/commands/speckit.checklist.md

description: Generate a custom checklist for the current feature based on user requirements.
---

## Checklist Purpose: "Unit Tests for English"

**CRITICAL CONCEPT**: Checklists are **UNIT TESTS FOR REQUIREMENTS WRITING** - they validate the quality, clarity, and completeness of requirements in a given domain.

**NOT for verification/testing**:

- ❌ NOT "Verify the button clicks correctly"
- ❌ NOT "Test error handling works"
- ❌ NOT "Confirm the API returns 200"
- ❌ NOT checking if code/implementation matches the spec

**FOR requirements quality validation**:

- ✅ "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined for all card types?" (completeness)
- ✅ "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" (clarity)
- ✅ "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" (consistency)
- ✅ "Are accessibility requirements defined for keyboard navigation?" (coverage)
- ✅ "Does the spec define what happens when logo image fails to load?" (edge cases)

**Metaphor**: If your spec is code written in English, the checklist is its unit test suite. You're testing whether the requirements are well-written, complete, unambiguous, and ready for implementation - NOT whether the implementation works.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Execution Steps

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list.
   - All file paths must be absolute.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Clarify intent (dynamic)**: Derive up to THREE initial contextual clarifying questions (no pre-baked catalog). They MUST:
   - Be generated from the user's phrasing + extracted signals from spec/plan/tasks
   - Only ask about information that materially changes checklist content
   - Be skipped individually if already unambiguous in `$ARGUMENTS`
   - Prefer precision over breadth

   Generation algorithm:
   1. Extract signals: feature domain keywords (e.g., auth, latency, UX, API), risk indicators ("critical", "must", "compliance"), stakeholder hints ("QA", "review", "security team"), and explicit deliverables ("a11y", "rollback", "contracts").
   2. Cluster signals into candidate focus areas (max 4) ranked by relevance.
   3. Identify probable audience & timing (author, reviewer, QA, release) if not explicit.
   4. Detect missing dimensions: scope breadth, depth/rigor, risk emphasis, exclusion boundaries, measurable acceptance criteria.
   5. Formulate questions chosen from these archetypes:
      - Scope refinement (e.g., "Should this include integration touchpoints with X and Y or stay limited to local module correctness?")
      - Risk prioritization (e.g., "Which of these potential risk areas should receive mandatory gating checks?")
      - Depth calibration (e.g., "Is this a lightweight pre-commit sanity list or a formal release gate?")
      - Audience framing (e.g., "Will this be used by the author only or peers during PR review?")
      - Boundary exclusion (e.g., "Should we explicitly exclude performance tuning items this round?")
      - Scenario class gap (e.g., "No recovery flows detected—are rollback / partial failure paths in scope?")

   Question formatting rules:
   - If presenting options, generate a compact table with columns: Option | Candidate | Why It Matters
   - Limit to A–E options maximum; omit table if a free-form answer is clearer
   - Never ask the user to restate what they already said
   - Avoid speculative categories (no hallucination). If uncertain, ask explicitly: "Confirm whether X belongs in scope."

   Defaults when interaction impossible:
   - Depth: Standard
   - Audience: Reviewer (PR) if code-related; Author otherwise
   - Focus: Top 2 relevance clusters

   Output the questions (label Q1/Q2/Q3). After answers: if ≥2 scenario classes (Alternate / Exception / Recovery / Non-Functional domain) remain unclear, you MAY ask up to TWO more targeted follow‑ups (Q4/Q5) with a one-line justification each (e.g., "Unresolved recovery path risk"). Do not exceed five total questions. Skip escalation if user explicitly declines more.

3. **Understand user request**: Combine `$ARGUMENTS` + clarifying answers:
   - Derive checklist theme (e.g., security, review, deploy, ux)
   - Consolidate explicit must-have items mentioned by user
   - Map focus selections to category scaffolding
   - Infer any missing context from spec/plan/tasks (do NOT hallucinate)

4. **Load feature context**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - spec.md: Feature requirements and scope
   - plan.md (if exists): Technical details, dependencies
   - tasks.md (if exists): Implementation tasks

   **Context Loading Strategy**:
   - Load only necessary portions relevant to active focus areas (avoid full-file dumping)
   - Prefer summarizing long sections into concise scenario/requirement bullets
   - Use progressive disclosure: add follow-on retrieval only if gaps detected
   - If source docs are large, generate interim summary items instead of embedding raw text

5. **Generate checklist** - Create "Unit Tests for Requirements":
   - Create `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/` directory if it doesn't exist
   - Generate unique checklist filename:
     - Use short, descriptive name based on domain (e.g., `ux.md`, `api.md`, `security.md`)
     - Format: `[domain].md`
     - If file exists, append to existing file
   - Number items sequentially starting from CHK001
   - Each `/speckit.checklist` run creates a NEW file (never overwrites existing checklists)

   **CORE PRINCIPLE - Test the Requirements, Not the Implementation**:
   Every checklist item MUST evaluate the REQUIREMENTS THEMSELVES for:
   - **Completeness**: Are all necessary requirements present?
   - **Clarity**: Are requirements unambiguous and specific?
   - **Consistency**: Do requirements align with each other?
   - **Measurability**: Can requirements be objectively verified?
   - **Coverage**: Are all scenarios/edge cases addressed?

   **Category Structure** - Group items by requirement quality dimensions:
   - **Requirement Completeness** (Are all necessary requirements documented?)
   - **Requirement Clarity** (Are requirements specific and unambiguous?)
   - **Requirement Consistency** (Do requirements align without conflicts?)
   - **Acceptance Criteria Quality** (Are success criteria measurable?)
   - **Scenario Coverage** (Are all flows/cases addressed?)
   - **Edge Case Coverage** (Are boundary conditions defined?)
   - **Non-Functional Requirements** (Performance, Security, Accessibility, etc. - are they specified?)
   - **Dependencies & Assumptions** (Are they documented and validated?)
   - **Ambiguities & Conflicts** (What needs clarification?)

   **HOW TO WRITE CHECKLIST ITEMS - "Unit Tests for English"**:

   ❌ **WRONG** (Testing implementation):
   - "Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards"
   - "Test hover states work on desktop"
   - "Confirm logo click navigates home"

   ✅ **CORRECT** (Testing requirements quality):
   - "Are the exact number and layout of featured episodes specified?" [Completeness]
   - "Is 'prominent display' quantified with specific sizing/positioning?" [Clarity]
   - "Are hover state requirements consistent across all interactive elements?" [Consistency]
   - "Are keyboard navigation requirements defined for all interactive UI?" [Coverage]
   - "Is the fallback behavior specified when logo image fails to load?" [Edge Cases]
   - "Are loading states defined for asynchronous episode data?" [Completeness]
   - "Does the spec define visual hierarchy for competing UI elements?" [Clarity]

   **ITEM STRUCTURE**:
   Each item should follow this pattern:
   - Question format asking about requirement quality
   - Focus on what's WRITTEN (or not written) in the spec/plan
   - Include quality dimension in brackets [Completeness/Clarity/Consistency/etc.]
   - Reference spec section `[Spec §X.Y]` when checking existing requirements
   - Use `[Gap]` marker when checking for missing requirements

   **EXAMPLES BY QUALITY DIMENSION**:

   Completeness:
   - "Are error handling requirements defined for all API failure modes? [Gap]"
   - "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Completeness]"
   - "Are mobile breakpoint requirements defined for responsive layouts? [Gap]"

   Clarity:
   - "Is 'fast loading' quantified with specific timing thresholds? [Clarity, Spec §NFR-2]"
   - "Are 'related episodes' selection criteria explicitly defined? [Clarity, Spec §FR-5]"
   - "Is 'prominent' defined with measurable visual properties? [Ambiguity, Spec §FR-4]"

   Consistency:
   - "Do navigation requirements align across all pages? [Consistency, Spec §FR-10]"
   - "Are card component requirements consistent between landing and detail pages? [Consistency]"

   Coverage:
   - "Are requirements defined for zero-state scenarios (no episodes)? [Coverage, Edge Case]"
   - "Are concurrent user interaction scenarios addressed? [Coverage, Gap]"
   - "Are requirements specified for partial data loading failures? [Coverage, Exception Flow]"

   Measurability:
   - "Are visual hierarchy requirements measurable/testable? [Acceptance Criteria, Spec §FR-1]"
   - "Can 'balanced visual weight' be objectively verified? [Measurability, Spec §FR-2]"

   **Scenario Classification & Coverage** (Requirements Quality Focus):
   - Check if requirements exist for: Primary, Alternate, Exception/Error, Recovery, Non-Functional scenarios
   - For each scenario class, ask: "Are [scenario type] requirements complete, clear, and consistent?"
   - If scenario class missing: "Are [scenario type] requirements intentionally excluded or missing? [Gap]"
   - Include resilience/rollback when state mutation occurs: "Are rollback requirements defined for migration failures? [Gap]"

   **Traceability Requirements**:
   - MINIMUM: ≥80% of items MUST include at least one traceability reference
   - Each item should reference: spec section `[Spec §X.Y]`, or use markers: `[Gap]`, `[Ambiguity]`, `[Conflict]`, `[Assumption]`
   - If no ID system exists: "Is a requirement & acceptance criteria ID scheme established? [Traceability]"

   **Surface & Resolve Issues** (Requirements Quality Problems):
   Ask questions about the requirements themselves:
   - Ambiguities: "Is the term 'fast' quantified with specific metrics? [Ambiguity, Spec §NFR-1]"
   - Conflicts: "Do navigation requirements conflict between §FR-10 and §FR-10a? [Conflict]"
   - Assumptions: "Is the assumption of 'always available podcast API' validated? [Assumption]"
   - Dependencies: "Are external podcast API requirements documented? [Dependency, Gap]"
   - Missing definitions: "Is 'visual hierarchy' defined with measurable criteria? [Gap]"

   **Content Consolidation**:
   - Soft cap: If raw candidate items > 40, prioritize by risk/impact
   - Merge near-duplicates checking the same requirement aspect
   - If >5 low-impact edge cases, create one item: "Are edge cases X, Y, Z addressed in requirements? [Coverage]"

   **🚫 ABSOLUTELY PROHIBITED** - These make it an implementation test, not a requirements test:
   - ❌ Any item starting with "Verify", "Test", "Confirm", "Check" + implementation behavior
   - ❌ References to code execution, user actions, system behavior
   - ❌ "Displays correctly", "works properly", "functions as expected"
   - ❌ "Click", "navigate", "render", "load", "execute"
   - ❌ Test cases, test plans, QA procedures
   - ❌ Implementation details (frameworks, APIs, algorithms)

   **✅ REQUIRED PATTERNS** - These test requirements quality:
   - ✅ "Are [requirement type] defined/specified/documented for [scenario]?"
   - ✅ "Is [vague term] quantified/clarified with specific criteria?"
   - ✅ "Are requirements consistent between [section A] and [section B]?"
   - ✅ "Can [requirement] be objectively measured/verified?"
   - ✅ "Are [edge cases/scenarios] addressed in requirements?"
   - ✅ "Does the spec define [missing aspect]?"

6. **Structure Reference**: Generate the checklist following the canonical template in `.specify/templates/checklist-template.md` for title, meta section, category headings, and ID formatting. If template is unavailable, use: H1 title, purpose/created meta lines, `##` category sections containing `- [ ] CHK### <requirement item>` lines with globally incrementing IDs starting at CHK001.

7. **Report**: Output full path to created checklist, item count, and remind user that each run creates a new file. Summarize:
   - Focus areas selected
   - Depth level
   - Actor/timing
   - Any explicit user-specified must-have items incorporated

**Important**: Each `/speckit.checklist` command invocation creates a checklist file using short, descriptive names unless file already exists. This allows:

- Multiple checklists of different types (e.g., `ux.md`, `test.md`, `security.md`)
- Simple, memorable filenames that indicate checklist purpose
- Easy identification and navigation in the `checklists/` folder

To avoid clutter, use descriptive types and clean up obsolete checklists when done.

## Example Checklist Types & Sample Items

**UX Requirements Quality:** `ux.md`

Sample items (testing the requirements, NOT the implementation):

- "Are visual hierarchy requirements defined with measurable criteria? [Clarity, Spec §FR-1]"
- "Is the number and positioning of UI elements explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-1]"
- "Are interaction state requirements (hover, focus, active) consistently defined? [Consistency]"
- "Are accessibility requirements specified for all interactive elements? [Coverage, Gap]"
- "Is fallback behavior defined when images fail to load? [Edge Case, Gap]"
- "Can 'prominent display' be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-4]"

**API Requirements Quality:** `api.md`

Sample items:

- "Are error response formats specified for all failure scenarios? [Completeness]"
- "Are rate limiting requirements quantified with specific thresholds? [Clarity]"
- "Are authentication requirements consistent across all endpoints? [Consistency]"
- "Are retry/timeout requirements defined for external dependencies? [Coverage, Gap]"

- "Is the threat model documented and requirements aligned to it? [Traceability]"
- "Are security requirements consistent with compliance obligations? [Consistency]"
- "Are security failure/breach response requirements defined? [Gap, Exception Flow]"

## Anti-Examples: What NOT To Do

**❌ WRONG - These test implementation, not requirements:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Verify landing page displays 3 episode cards [Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Test hover states work correctly on desktop [Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Confirm logo click navigates to home page [Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Check that related episodes section shows 3-5 items [Spec §FR-005]
```

**✅ CORRECT - These test requirements quality:**

```markdown
- [ ] CHK001 - Are the number and layout of featured episodes explicitly specified? [Completeness, Spec §FR-001]
- [ ] CHK002 - Are hover state requirements consistently defined for all interactive elements? [Consistency, Spec §FR-003]
- [ ] CHK003 - Are navigation requirements clear for all clickable brand elements? [Clarity, Spec §FR-010]
- [ ] CHK004 - Is the selection criteria for related episodes documented? [Gap, Spec §FR-005]
- [ ] CHK005 - Are loading state requirements defined for asynchronous episode data? [Gap]
- [ ] CHK006 - Can "visual hierarchy" requirements be objectively measured? [Measurability, Spec §FR-001]
```

**Key Differences:**

- Wrong: Tests if the system works correctly
- Correct: Tests if the requirements are written correctly
- Wrong: Verification of behavior
- Correct: Validation of requirement quality
- Wrong: "Does it do X?"
- Correct: "Is X clearly specified?"

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

Goal: Detect and reduce ambiguity or missing decision points in the active feature specification and record the clarifications directly in the spec file.

Note: This clarification workflow is expected to run (and be completed) BEFORE invoking `/speckit.plan`. If the user explicitly states they are skipping clarification (e.g., exploratory spike), you may proceed, but must warn that downstream rework risk increases.

Execution steps:

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --paths-only` from repo root **once** (combined `--json --paths-only` mode / `-Json -PathsOnly`). Parse minimal JSON payload fields:
   - `FEATURE_DIR`
   - `FEATURE_SPEC`
   - (Optionally capture `IMPL_PLAN`, `TASKS` for future chained flows.)
   - If JSON parsing fails, abort and instruct user to re-run `/speckit.specify` or verify feature branch environment.
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. Load the current spec file. Perform a structured ambiguity & coverage scan using this taxonomy. For each category, mark status: Clear / Partial / Missing. Produce an internal coverage map used for prioritization (do not output raw map unless no questions will be asked).

   Functional Scope & Behavior:
   - Core user goals & success criteria
   - Explicit out-of-scope declarations
   - User roles / personas differentiation

   Domain & Data Model:
   - Entities, attributes, relationships
   - Identity & uniqueness rules
   - Lifecycle/state transitions
   - Data volume / scale assumptions

   Interaction & UX Flow:
   - Critical user journeys / sequences
   - Error/empty/loading states
   - Accessibility or localization notes

   Non-Functional Quality Attributes:
   - Performance (latency, throughput targets)
   - Scalability (horizontal/vertical, limits)
   - Reliability & availability (uptime, recovery expectations)
   - Observability (logging, metrics, tracing signals)
   - Security & privacy (authN/Z, data protection, threat assumptions)
   - Compliance / regulatory constraints (if any)

   Integration & External Dependencies:
   - External services/APIs and failure modes
   - Data import/export formats
   - Protocol/versioning assumptions

   Edge Cases & Failure Handling:
   - Negative scenarios
   - Rate limiting / throttling
   - Conflict resolution (e.g., concurrent edits)

   Constraints & Tradeoffs:
   - Technical constraints (language, storage, hosting)
   - Explicit tradeoffs or rejected alternatives

   Terminology & Consistency:
   - Canonical glossary terms
   - Avoided synonyms / deprecated terms

   Completion Signals:
   - Acceptance criteria testability
   - Measurable Definition of Done style indicators

   Misc / Placeholders:
   - TODO markers / unresolved decisions
   - Ambiguous adjectives ("robust", "intuitive") lacking quantification

   For each category with Partial or Missing status, add a candidate question opportunity unless:
   - Clarification would not materially change implementation or validation strategy
   - Information is better deferred to planning phase (note internally)

3. Generate (internally) a prioritized queue of candidate clarification questions (maximum 5). Do NOT output them all at once. Apply these constraints:
    - Maximum of 10 total questions across the whole session.
    - Each question must be answerable with EITHER:
       - A short multiple‑choice selection (2–5 distinct, mutually exclusive options), OR
       - A one-word / short‑phrase answer (explicitly constrain: "Answer in <=5 words").
    - Only include questions whose answers materially impact architecture, data modeling, task decomposition, test design, UX behavior, operational readiness, or compliance validation.
    - Ensure category coverage balance: attempt to cover the highest impact unresolved categories first; avoid asking two low-impact questions when a single high-impact area (e.g., security posture) is unresolved.
    - Exclude questions already answered, trivial stylistic preferences, or plan-level execution details (unless blocking correctness).
    - Favor clarifications that reduce downstream rework risk or prevent misaligned acceptance tests.
    - If more than 5 categories remain unresolved, select the top 5 by (Impact * Uncertainty) heuristic.

4. Sequential questioning loop (interactive):
    - Present EXACTLY ONE question at a time.
    - For multiple‑choice questions:
       - **Analyze all options** and determine the **most suitable option** based on:
          - Best practices for the project type
          - Common patterns in similar implementations
          - Risk reduction (security, performance, maintainability)
          - Alignment with any explicit project goals or constraints visible in the spec
       - Present your **recommended option prominently** at the top with clear reasoning (1-2 sentences explaining why this is the best choice).
       - Format as: `**Recommended:** Option [X] - <reasoning>`
       - Then render all options as a Markdown table:

       | Option | Description |
       |--------|-------------|
       | A | <Option A description> |
       | B | <Option B description> |
       | C | <Option C description> (add D/E as needed up to 5) |
       | Short | Provide a different short answer (<=5 words) (Include only if free-form alternative is appropriate) |

       - After the table, add: `You can reply with the option letter (e.g., "A"), accept the recommendation by saying "yes" or "recommended", or provide your own short answer.`
    - For short‑answer style (no meaningful discrete options):
       - Provide your **suggested answer** based on best practices and context.
       - Format as: `**Suggested:** <your proposed answer> - <brief reasoning>`
       - Then output: `Format: Short answer (<=5 words). You can accept the suggestion by saying "yes" or "suggested", or provide your own answer.`
    - After the user answers:
       - If the user replies with "yes", "recommended", or "suggested", use your previously stated recommendation/suggestion as the answer.
       - Otherwise, validate the answer maps to one option or fits the <=5 word constraint.
       - If ambiguous, ask for a quick disambiguation (count still belongs to same question; do not advance).
       - Once satisfactory, record it in working memory (do not yet write to disk) and move to the next queued question.
    - Stop asking further questions when:
       - All critical ambiguities resolved early (remaining queued items become unnecessary), OR
       - User signals completion ("done", "good", "no more"), OR
       - You reach 5 asked questions.
    - Never reveal future queued questions in advance.
    - If no valid questions exist at start, immediately report no critical ambiguities.

5. Integration after EACH accepted answer (incremental update approach):
    - Maintain in-memory representation of the spec (loaded once at start) plus the raw file contents.
    - For the first integrated answer in this session:
       - Ensure a `## Clarifications` section exists (create it just after the highest-level contextual/overview section per the spec template if missing).
       - Under it, create (if not present) a `### Session YYYY-MM-DD` subheading for today.
    - Append a bullet line immediately after acceptance: `- Q: <question> → A: <final answer>`.
    - Then immediately apply the clarification to the most appropriate section(s):
       - Functional ambiguity → Update or add a bullet in Functional Requirements.
       - User interaction / actor distinction → Update User Stories or Actors subsection (if present) with clarified role, constraint, or scenario.
       - Data shape / entities → Update Data Model (add fields, types, relationships) preserving ordering; note added constraints succinctly.
       - Non-functional constraint → Add/modify measurable criteria in Non-Functional / Quality Attributes section (convert vague adjective to metric or explicit target).
       - Edge case / negative flow → Add a new bullet under Edge Cases / Error Handling (or create such subsection if template provides placeholder for it).
       - Terminology conflict → Normalize term across spec; retain original only if necessary by adding `(formerly referred to as "X")` once.
    - If the clarification invalidates an earlier ambiguous statement, replace that statement instead of duplicating; leave no obsolete contradictory text.
    - Save the spec file AFTER each integration to minimize risk of context loss (atomic overwrite).
    - Preserve formatting: do not reorder unrelated sections; keep heading hierarchy intact.
    - Keep each inserted clarification minimal and testable (avoid narrative drift).

6. Validation (performed after EACH write plus final pass):
   - Clarifications session contains exactly one bullet per accepted answer (no duplicates).
   - Total asked (accepted) questions ≤ 5.
   - Updated sections contain no lingering vague placeholders the new answer was meant to resolve.
   - No contradictory earlier statement remains (scan for now-invalid alternative choices removed).
   - Markdown structure valid; only allowed new headings: `## Clarifications`, `### Session YYYY-MM-DD`.
   - Terminology consistency: same canonical term used across all updated sections.

7. Write the updated spec back to `FEATURE_SPEC`.

8. Report completion (after questioning loop ends or early termination):
   - Number of questions asked & answered.
   - Path to updated spec.
   - Sections touched (list names).
   - Coverage summary table listing each taxonomy category with Status: Resolved (was Partial/Missing and addressed), Deferred (exceeds question quota or better suited for planning), Clear (already sufficient), Outstanding (still Partial/Missing but low impact).
   - If any Outstanding or Deferred remain, recommend whether to proceed to `/speckit.plan` or run `/speckit.clarify` again later post-plan.
   - Suggested next command.

Behavior rules:

- If no meaningful ambiguities found (or all potential questions would be low-impact), respond: "No critical ambiguities detected worth formal clarification." and suggest proceeding.
- If spec file missing, instruct user to run `/speckit.specify` first (do not create a new spec here).
- Never exceed 5 total asked questions (clarification retries for a single question do not count as new questions).
- Avoid speculative tech stack questions unless the absence blocks functional clarity.
- Respect user early termination signals ("stop", "done", "proceed").
- If no questions asked due to full coverage, output a compact coverage summary (all categories Clear) then suggest advancing.
- If quota reached with unresolved high-impact categories remaining, explicitly flag them under Deferred with rationale.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

You are updating the project constitution at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. This file is a TEMPLATE containing placeholder tokens in square brackets (e.g. `[PROJECT_NAME]`, `[PRINCIPLE_1_NAME]`). Your job is to (a) collect/derive concrete values, (b) fill the template precisely, and (c) propagate any amendments across dependent artifacts.

Follow this execution flow:

1. Load the existing constitution template at `.specify/memory/constitution.md`.
   - Identify every placeholder token of the form `[ALL_CAPS_IDENTIFIER]`.
   **IMPORTANT**: The user might require less or more principles than the ones used in the template. If a number is specified, respect that - follow the general template. You will update the doc accordingly.

2. Collect/derive values for placeholders:
   - If user input (conversation) supplies a value, use it.
   - Otherwise infer from existing repo context (README, docs, prior constitution versions if embedded).
   - For governance dates: `RATIFICATION_DATE` is the original adoption date (if unknown ask or mark TODO), `LAST_AMENDED_DATE` is today if changes are made, otherwise keep previous.
   - `CONSTITUTION_VERSION` must increment according to semantic versioning rules:
     - MAJOR: Backward incompatible governance/principle removals or redefinitions.
     - MINOR: New principle/section added or materially expanded guidance.
     - PATCH: Clarifications, wording, typo fixes, non-semantic refinements.
   - If version bump type ambiguous, propose reasoning before finalizing.

3. Draft the updated constitution content:
   - Replace every placeholder with concrete text (no bracketed tokens left except intentionally retained template slots that the project has chosen not to define yet—explicitly justify any left).
   - Preserve heading hierarchy and comments can be removed once replaced unless they still add clarifying guidance.
   - Ensure each Principle section: succinct name line, paragraph (or bullet list) capturing non‑negotiable rules, explicit rationale if not obvious.
   - Ensure Governance section lists amendment procedure, versioning policy, and compliance review expectations.

4. Consistency propagation checklist (convert prior checklist into active validations):
   - Read `.specify/templates/plan-template.md` and ensure any "Constitution Check" or rules align with updated principles.
   - Read `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` for scope/requirements alignment—update if constitution adds/removes mandatory sections or constraints.
   - Read `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` and ensure task categorization reflects new or removed principle-driven task types (e.g., observability, versioning, testing discipline).
   - Read each command file in `.specify/templates/commands/*.md` (including this one) to verify no outdated references (agent-specific names like CLAUDE only) remain when generic guidance is required.
   - Read any runtime guidance docs (e.g., `README.md`, `docs/quickstart.md`, or agent-specific guidance files if present). Update references to principles changed.

5. Produce a Sync Impact Report (prepend as an HTML comment at top of the constitution file after update):
   - Version change: old → new
   - List of modified principles (old title → new title if renamed)
   - Added sections
   - Removed sections
   - Templates requiring updates (✅ updated / ⚠ pending) with file paths
   - Follow-up TODOs if any placeholders intentionally deferred.

6. Validation before final output:
   - No remaining unexplained bracket tokens.
   - Version line matches report.
   - Dates ISO format YYYY-MM-DD.
   - Principles are declarative, testable, and free of vague language ("should" → replace with MUST/SHOULD rationale where appropriate).

7. Write the completed constitution back to `.specify/memory/constitution.md` (overwrite).

8. Output a final summary to the user with:
   - New version and bump rationale.
   - Any files flagged for manual follow-up.
   - Suggested commit message (e.g., `docs: amend constitution to vX.Y.Z (principle additions + governance update)`).

Formatting & Style Requirements:

- Use Markdown headings exactly as in the template (do not demote/promote levels).
- Wrap long rationale lines to keep readability (<100 chars ideally) but do not hard enforce with awkward breaks.
- Keep a single blank line between sections.
- Avoid trailing whitespace.

If the user supplies partial updates (e.g., only one principle revision), still perform validation and version decision steps.

If critical info missing (e.g., ratification date truly unknown), insert `TODO(<FIELD_NAME>): explanation` and include in the Sync Impact Report under deferred items.

Do not create a new template; always operate on the existing `.specify/memory/constitution.md` file.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Check checklists status** (if FEATURE_DIR/checklists/ exists):
   - Scan all checklist files in the checklists/ directory
   - For each checklist, count:
     - Total items: All lines matching `- [ ]` or `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Completed items: Lines matching `- [X]` or `- [x]`
     - Incomplete items: Lines matching `- [ ]`
   - Create a status table:

     ```text
     | Checklist | Total | Completed | Incomplete | Status |
     |-----------|-------|-----------|------------|--------|
     | ux.md     | 12    | 12        | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     | test.md   | 8     | 5         | 3          | ✗ FAIL |
     | security.md | 6   | 6         | 0          | ✓ PASS |
     ```

   - Calculate overall status:
     - **PASS**: All checklists have 0 incomplete items
     - **FAIL**: One or more checklists have incomplete items

   - **If any checklist is incomplete**:
     - Display the table with incomplete item counts
     - **STOP** and ask: "Some checklists are incomplete. Do you want to proceed with implementation anyway? (yes/no)"
     - Wait for user response before continuing
     - If user says "no" or "wait" or "stop", halt execution
     - If user says "yes" or "proceed" or "continue", proceed to step 3

   - **If all checklists are complete**:
     - Display the table showing all checklists passed
     - Automatically proceed to step 3

3. Load and analyze the implementation context:
   - **REQUIRED**: Read tasks.md for the complete task list and execution plan
   - **REQUIRED**: Read plan.md for tech stack, architecture, and file structure
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read data-model.md for entities and relationships
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read contracts/ for API specifications and test requirements
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read research.md for technical decisions and constraints
   - **IF EXISTS**: Read quickstart.md for integration scenarios

4. **Project Setup Verification**:
   - **REQUIRED**: Create/verify ignore files based on actual project setup:

   **Detection & Creation Logic**:
   - Check if the following command succeeds to determine if the repository is a git repo (create/verify .gitignore if so):

     ```sh
     git rev-parse --git-dir 2>/dev/null
     ```

   - Check if Dockerfile* exists or Docker in plan.md → create/verify .dockerignore
   - Check if .eslintrc* exists → create/verify .eslintignore
   - Check if eslint.config.* exists → ensure the config's `ignores` entries cover required patterns
   - Check if .prettierrc* exists → create/verify .prettierignore
   - Check if .npmrc or package.json exists → create/verify .npmignore (if publishing)
   - Check if terraform files (*.tf) exist → create/verify .terraformignore
   - Check if .helmignore needed (helm charts present) → create/verify .helmignore

   **If ignore file already exists**: Verify it contains essential patterns, append missing critical patterns only
   **If ignore file missing**: Create with full pattern set for detected technology

   - **Prettier**: `node_modules/`, `dist/`, `build/`, `coverage/`, `package-lock.json`, `yarn.lock`, `pnpm-lock.yaml`
   - **Terraform**: `.terraform/`, `*.tfstate*`, `*.tfvars`, `.terraform.lock.hcl`
   - **Kubernetes/k8s**: `*.secret.yaml`, `secrets/`, `.kube/`, `kubeconfig*`, `*.key`, `*.crt`

5. Parse tasks.md structure and extract:
   - **Task phases**: Setup, Tests, Core, Integration, Polish
   - **Task dependencies**: Sequential vs parallel execution rules
   - **Task details**: ID, description, file paths, parallel markers [P]
   - **Execution flow**: Order and dependency requirements

6. Execute implementation following the task plan:
   - **Phase-by-phase execution**: Complete each phase before moving to the next
   - **Respect dependencies**: Run sequential tasks in order, parallel tasks [P] can run together  
   - **Follow TDD approach**: Execute test tasks before their corresponding implementation tasks
   - **File-based coordination**: Tasks affecting the same files must run sequentially
   - **Validation checkpoints**: Verify each phase completion before proceeding

7. Implementation execution rules:
   - **Setup first**: Initialize project structure, dependencies, configuration
   - **Tests before code**: If you need to write tests for contracts, entities, and integration scenarios
   - **Core development**: Implement models, services, CLI commands, endpoints
   - **Integration work**: Database connections, middleware, logging, external services
   - **Polish and validation**: Unit tests, performance optimization, documentation

8. Progress tracking and error handling:
   - Report progress after each completed task
   - Halt execution if any non-parallel task fails
   - For parallel tasks [P], continue with successful tasks, report failed ones
   - Provide clear error messages with context for debugging
   - Suggest next steps if implementation cannot proceed
   - **IMPORTANT** For completed tasks, make sure to mark the task off as [X] in the tasks file.

9. Completion validation:
   - Verify all required tasks are completed
   - Check that implemented features match the original specification
   - Validate that tests pass and coverage meets requirements
   - Confirm the implementation follows the technical plan
   - Report final status with summary of completed work

Note: This command assumes a complete task breakdown exists in tasks.md. If tasks are incomplete or missing, suggest running `/speckit.tasks` first to regenerate the task list.

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/setup-plan.sh --json` from repo root and parse JSON for FEATURE_SPEC, IMPL_PLAN, SPECS_DIR, BRANCH. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load context**: Read FEATURE_SPEC and `.specify/memory/constitution.md`. Load IMPL_PLAN template (already copied).

3. **Execute plan workflow**: Follow the structure in IMPL_PLAN template to:
   - Fill Technical Context (mark unknowns as "NEEDS CLARIFICATION")
   - Fill Constitution Check section from constitution
   - Evaluate gates (ERROR if violations unjustified)
   - Phase 0: Generate research.md (resolve all NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   - Phase 1: Generate data-model.md, contracts/, quickstart.md
   - Phase 1: Update agent context by running the agent script
   - Re-evaluate Constitution Check post-design

4. **Stop and report**: Command ends after Phase 2 planning. Report branch, IMPL_PLAN path, and generated artifacts.

## Phases

### Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```text
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

### Phase 1: Design & Contracts

**Prerequisites:** `research.md` complete

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Agent context update**:
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh claude`
   - These scripts detect which AI agent is in use
   - Update the appropriate agent-specific context file
   - Add only new technology from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/*, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Key rules

- Use absolute paths
- ERROR on gate failures or unresolved clarifications

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

The text the user typed after `/speckit.specify` in the triggering message **is** the feature description. Assume you always have it available in this conversation even if `$ARGUMENTS` appears literally below. Do not ask the user to repeat it unless they provided an empty command.

Given that feature description, do this:

1. **Generate a concise short name** (2-4 words) for the branch:
   - Analyze the feature description and extract the most meaningful keywords
   - Create a 2-4 word short name that captures the essence of the feature
   - Use action-noun format when possible (e.g., "add-user-auth", "fix-payment-bug")
   - Preserve technical terms and acronyms (OAuth2, API, JWT, etc.)
   - Keep it concise but descriptive enough to understand the feature at a glance
   - Examples:
     - "I want to add user authentication" → "user-auth"
     - "Implement OAuth2 integration for the API" → "oauth2-api-integration"
     - "Create a dashboard for analytics" → "analytics-dashboard"
     - "Fix payment processing timeout bug" → "fix-payment-timeout"

2. **Check for existing branches before creating new one**:
   
   a. First, fetch all remote branches to ensure we have the latest information:
      ```bash
      git fetch --all --prune
      ```
   
   b. Find the highest feature number across all sources for the short-name:
      - Remote branches: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E 'refs/heads/[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Local branches: `git branch | grep -E '^[* ]*[0-9]+-<short-name>$'`
      - Specs directories: Check for directories matching `specs/[0-9]+-<short-name>`
   
   c. Determine the next available number:
      - Extract all numbers from all three sources
      - Find the highest number N
      - Use N+1 for the new branch number
   
   d. Run the script `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS"` with the calculated number and short-name:
      - Pass `--number N+1` and `--short-name "your-short-name"` along with the feature description
      - Bash example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" --json --number 5 --short-name "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
      - PowerShell example: `.specify/scripts/bash/create-new-feature.sh --json "$ARGUMENTS" -Json -Number 5 -ShortName "user-auth" "Add user authentication"`
   
   **IMPORTANT**:
   - Check all three sources (remote branches, local branches, specs directories) to find the highest number
   - Only match branches/directories with the exact short-name pattern
   - If no existing branches/directories found with this short-name, start with number 1
   - You must only ever run this script once per feature
   - The JSON is provided in the terminal as output - always refer to it to get the actual content you're looking for
   - The JSON output will contain BRANCH_NAME and SPEC_FILE paths
   - For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot")

3. Load `.specify/templates/spec-template.md` to understand required sections.

4. Follow this execution flow:

    1. Parse user description from Input
       If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
    2. Extract key concepts from description
       Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
    3. For unclear aspects:
       - Make informed guesses based on context and industry standards
       - Only mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] if:
         - The choice significantly impacts feature scope or user experience
         - Multiple reasonable interpretations exist with different implications
         - No reasonable default exists
       - **LIMIT: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers total**
       - Prioritize clarifications by impact: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
    4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
       If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
    5. Generate Functional Requirements
       Each requirement must be testable
       Use reasonable defaults for unspecified details (document assumptions in Assumptions section)
    6. Define Success Criteria
       Create measurable, technology-agnostic outcomes
       Include both quantitative metrics (time, performance, volume) and qualitative measures (user satisfaction, task completion)
       Each criterion must be verifiable without implementation details
    7. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
    8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)

5. Write the specification to SPEC_FILE using the template structure, replacing placeholders with concrete details derived from the feature description (arguments) while preserving section order and headings.

6. **Specification Quality Validation**: After writing the initial spec, validate it against quality criteria:

   a. **Create Spec Quality Checklist**: Generate a checklist file at `FEATURE_DIR/checklists/requirements.md` using the checklist template structure with these validation items:

      ```markdown
      # Specification Quality Checklist: [FEATURE NAME]
      
      **Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
      **Created**: [DATE]
      **Feature**: [Link to spec.md]
      
      ## Content Quality
      
      - [ ] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
      - [ ] Focused on user value and business needs
      - [ ] Written for non-technical stakeholders
      - [ ] All mandatory sections completed
      
      ## Requirement Completeness
      
      - [ ] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
      - [ ] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
      - [ ] Success criteria are measurable
      - [ ] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
      - [ ] All acceptance scenarios are defined
      - [ ] Edge cases are identified
      - [ ] Scope is clearly bounded
      - [ ] Dependencies and assumptions identified
      
      ## Feature Readiness
      
      - [ ] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
      - [ ] User scenarios cover primary flows
      - [ ] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
      - [ ] No implementation details leak into specification
      
      ## Notes
      
      - Items marked incomplete require spec updates before `/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`
      ```

   b. **Run Validation Check**: Review the spec against each checklist item:
      - For each item, determine if it passes or fails
      - Document specific issues found (quote relevant spec sections)

   c. **Handle Validation Results**:

      - **If all items pass**: Mark checklist complete and proceed to step 6

      - **If items fail (excluding [NEEDS CLARIFICATION])**:
        1. List the failing items and specific issues
        2. Update the spec to address each issue
        3. Re-run validation until all items pass (max 3 iterations)
        4. If still failing after 3 iterations, document remaining issues in checklist notes and warn user

      - **If [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain**:
        1. Extract all [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: ...] markers from the spec
        2. **LIMIT CHECK**: If more than 3 markers exist, keep only the 3 most critical (by scope/security/UX impact) and make informed guesses for the rest
        3. For each clarification needed (max 3), present options to user in this format:

           ```markdown
           ## Question [N]: [Topic]
           
           **Context**: [Quote relevant spec section]
           
           **What we need to know**: [Specific question from NEEDS CLARIFICATION marker]
           
           **Suggested Answers**:
           
           | Option | Answer | Implications |
           |--------|--------|--------------|
           | A      | [First suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | B      | [Second suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | C      | [Third suggested answer] | [What this means for the feature] |
           | Custom | Provide your own answer | [Explain how to provide custom input] |
           
           **Your choice**: _[Wait for user response]_
           ```

        4. **CRITICAL - Table Formatting**: Ensure markdown tables are properly formatted:
           - Use consistent spacing with pipes aligned
           - Each cell should have spaces around content: `| Content |` not `|Content|`
           - Header separator must have at least 3 dashes: `|--------|`
           - Test that the table renders correctly in markdown preview
        5. Number questions sequentially (Q1, Q2, Q3 - max 3 total)
        6. Present all questions together before waiting for responses
        7. Wait for user to respond with their choices for all questions (e.g., "Q1: A, Q2: Custom - [details], Q3: B")
        8. Update the spec by replacing each [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] marker with the user's selected or provided answer
        9. Re-run validation after all clarifications are resolved

   d. **Update Checklist**: After each validation iteration, update the checklist file with current pass/fail status

7. Report completion with branch name, spec file path, checklist results, and readiness for the next phase (`/speckit.clarify` or `/speckit.plan`).

**NOTE:** The script creates and checks out the new branch and initializes the spec file before writing.

## General Guidelines

## Quick Guidelines

- Focus on **WHAT** users need and **WHY**.
- Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure).
- Written for business stakeholders, not developers.
- DO NOT create any checklists that are embedded in the spec. That will be a separate command.

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Make informed guesses**: Use context, industry standards, and common patterns to fill gaps
2. **Document assumptions**: Record reasonable defaults in the Assumptions section
3. **Limit clarifications**: Maximum 3 [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - use only for critical decisions that:
   - Significantly impact feature scope or user experience
   - Have multiple reasonable interpretations with different implications
   - Lack any reasonable default
4. **Prioritize clarifications**: scope > security/privacy > user experience > technical details
5. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
6. **Common areas needing clarification** (only if no reasonable default exists):
   - Feature scope and boundaries (include/exclude specific use cases)
   - User types and permissions (if multiple conflicting interpretations possible)
   - Security/compliance requirements (when legally/financially significant)

**Examples of reasonable defaults** (don't ask about these):

- Data retention: Industry-standard practices for the domain
- Performance targets: Standard web/mobile app expectations unless specified
- Error handling: User-friendly messages with appropriate fallbacks
- Authentication method: Standard session-based or OAuth2 for web apps
- Integration patterns: RESTful APIs unless specified otherwise

### Success Criteria Guidelines

Success criteria must be:

1. **Measurable**: Include specific metrics (time, percentage, count, rate)
2. **Technology-agnostic**: No mention of frameworks, languages, databases, or tools
3. **User-focused**: Describe outcomes from user/business perspective, not system internals
4. **Verifiable**: Can be tested/validated without knowing implementation details

**Good examples**:

- "Users can complete checkout in under 3 minutes"
- "System supports 10,000 concurrent users"
- "95% of searches return results in under 1 second"
- "Task completion rate improves by 40%"

**Bad examples** (implementation-focused):

- "API response time is under 200ms" (too technical, use "Users see results instantly")
- "Database can handle 1000 TPS" (implementation detail, use user-facing metric)
- "React components render efficiently" (framework-specific)
- "Redis cache hit rate above 80%" (technology-specific)

## User Input

```text
$ARGUMENTS
```

You **MUST** consider the user input before proceeding (if not empty).

## Outline

1. **Setup**: Run `.specify/scripts/bash/check-prerequisites.sh --json` from repo root and parse FEATURE_DIR and AVAILABLE_DOCS list. All paths must be absolute. For single quotes in args like "I'm Groot", use escape syntax: e.g 'I'\''m Groot' (or double-quote if possible: "I'm Groot").

2. **Load design documents**: Read from FEATURE_DIR:
   - **Required**: plan.md (tech stack, libraries, structure), spec.md (user stories with priorities)
   - **Optional**: data-model.md (entities), contracts/ (API endpoints), research.md (decisions), quickstart.md (test scenarios)
   - Note: Not all projects have all documents. Generate tasks based on what's available.

3. **Execute task generation workflow**:
   - Load plan.md and extract tech stack, libraries, project structure
   - Load spec.md and extract user stories with their priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.)
   - If data-model.md exists: Extract entities and map to user stories
   - If contracts/ exists: Map endpoints to user stories
   - If research.md exists: Extract decisions for setup tasks
   - Generate tasks organized by user story (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Generate dependency graph showing user story completion order
   - Create parallel execution examples per user story
   - Validate task completeness (each user story has all needed tasks, independently testable)

4. **Generate tasks.md**: Use `.specify.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as structure, fill with:
   - Correct feature name from plan.md
   - Phase 1: Setup tasks (project initialization)
   - Phase 2: Foundational tasks (blocking prerequisites for all user stories)
   - Phase 3+: One phase per user story (in priority order from spec.md)
   - Each phase includes: story goal, independent test criteria, tests (if requested), implementation tasks
   - Final Phase: Polish & cross-cutting concerns
   - All tasks must follow the strict checklist format (see Task Generation Rules below)
   - Clear file paths for each task
   - Dependencies section showing story completion order
   - Parallel execution examples per story
   - Implementation strategy section (MVP first, incremental delivery)

5. **Report**: Output path to generated tasks.md and summary:
   - Total task count
   - Task count per user story
   - Parallel opportunities identified
   - Independent test criteria for each story
   - Suggested MVP scope (typically just User Story 1)
   - Format validation: Confirm ALL tasks follow the checklist format (checkbox, ID, labels, file paths)

Context for task generation: $ARGUMENTS

The tasks.md should be immediately executable - each task must be specific enough that an LLM can complete it without additional context.

## Task Generation Rules

**CRITICAL**: Tasks MUST be organized by user story to enable independent implementation and testing.

**Tests are OPTIONAL**: Only generate test tasks if explicitly requested in the feature specification or if user requests TDD approach.

### Checklist Format (REQUIRED)

Every task MUST strictly follow this format:

```text
- [ ] [TaskID] [P?] [Story?] Description with file path
```

**Format Components**:

1. **Checkbox**: ALWAYS start with `- [ ]` (markdown checkbox)
2. **Task ID**: Sequential number (T001, T002, T003...) in execution order
3. **[P] marker**: Include ONLY if task is parallelizable (different files, no dependencies on incomplete tasks)
4. **[Story] label**: REQUIRED for user story phase tasks only
   - Format: [US1], [US2], [US3], etc. (maps to user stories from spec.md)
   - Setup phase: NO story label
   - Foundational phase: NO story label  
   - User Story phases: MUST have story label
   - Polish phase: NO story label
5. **Description**: Clear action with exact file path

**Examples**:

- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication middleware in src/middleware/auth.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create User model in src/models/user.py`
- ✅ CORRECT: `- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement UserService in src/services/user_service.py`
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] Create User model` (missing ID and Story label)
- ❌ WRONG: `T001 [US1] Create model` (missing checkbox)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] [US1] Create User model` (missing Task ID)
- ❌ WRONG: `- [ ] T001 [US1] Create model` (missing file path)

### Task Organization

1. **From User Stories (spec.md)** - PRIMARY ORGANIZATION:
   - Each user story (P1, P2, P3...) gets its own phase
   - Map all related components to their story:
     - Models needed for that story
     - Services needed for that story
     - Endpoints/UI needed for that story
     - If tests requested: Tests specific to that story
   - Mark story dependencies (most stories should be independent)

2. **From Contracts**:
   - Map each contract/endpoint → to the user story it serves
   - If tests requested: Each contract → contract test task [P] before implementation in that story's phase

3. **From Data Model**:
   - Map each entity to the user story(ies) that need it
   - If entity serves multiple stories: Put in earliest story or Setup phase
   - Relationships → service layer tasks in appropriate story phase

4. **From Setup/Infrastructure**:
   - Shared infrastructure → Setup phase (Phase 1)
   - Foundational/blocking tasks → Foundational phase (Phase 2)
   - Story-specific setup → within that story's phase

### Phase Structure

- **Phase 1**: Setup (project initialization)
- **Phase 2**: Foundational (blocking prerequisites - MUST complete before user stories)
- **Phase 3+**: User Stories in priority order (P1, P2, P3...)
  - Within each story: Tests (if requested) → Models → Services → Endpoints → Integration
  - Each phase should be a complete, independently testable increment
- **Final Phase**: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

Consolidated prerequisite checking for Spec-Driven Development workflow.

OPTIONS:
  --json              Output in JSON format
  --require-tasks     Require tasks.md to exist (for implementation phase)
  --include-tasks     Include tasks.md in AVAILABLE_DOCS list
  --paths-only        Only output path variables (no prerequisite validation)
  --help, -h          Show this help message

EXAMPLES:
  # Check task prerequisites (plan.md required)
  ./check-prerequisites.sh --json
  
  # Check implementation prerequisites (plan.md + tasks.md required)
  ./check-prerequisites.sh --json --require-tasks --include-tasks
  
  # Get feature paths only (no validation)
  ./check-prerequisites.sh --paths-only

# Update agent context files with information from plan.md
#
# This script maintains AI agent context files by parsing feature specifications 
# and updating agent-specific configuration files with project information.
#
# MAIN FUNCTIONS:
# 1. Environment Validation
#    - Verifies git repository structure and branch information
#    - Checks for required plan.md files and templates
#    - Validates file permissions and accessibility
#
# 2. Plan Data Extraction
#    - Parses plan.md files to extract project metadata
#    - Identifies language/version, frameworks, databases, and project types
#    - Handles missing or incomplete specification data gracefully
#
# 3. Agent File Management
#    - Creates new agent context files from templates when needed
#    - Updates existing agent files with new project information
#    - Preserves manual additions and custom configurations
#    - Supports multiple AI agent formats and directory structures
#
# 4. Content Generation
#    - Generates language-specific build/test commands
#    - Creates appropriate project directory structures
#    - Updates technology stacks and recent changes sections
#    - Maintains consistent formatting and timestamps
#
# 5. Multi-Agent Support
#    - Handles agent-specific file paths and naming conventions
#    - Supports: Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Cursor, Qwen, opencode, Codex, Windsurf, Kilo Code, Auggie CLI, Roo Code, CodeBuddy CLI, Amp, SHAI, or Amazon Q Developer CLI
#    - Can update single agents or all existing agent files
#    - Creates default Claude file if no agent files exist
#
# Usage: ./update-agent-context.sh [agent_type]
# Agent types: claude|gemini|copilot|cursor-agent|qwen|opencode|codex|windsurf|kilocode|auggie|shai|q
# Leave empty to update all existing agent files

# Feature Specification: [FEATURE NAME]

**Feature Branch**: `[###-feature-name]`  
**Created**: [DATE]  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "$ARGUMENTS"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

<!--
  IMPORTANT: User stories should be PRIORITIZED as user journeys ordered by importance.
  Each user story/journey must be INDEPENDENTLY TESTABLE - meaning if you implement just ONE of them,
  you should still have a viable MVP (Minimum Viable Product) that delivers value.
  
  Assign priorities (P1, P2, P3, etc.) to each story, where P1 is the most critical.
  Think of each story as a standalone slice of functionality that can be:
  - Developed independently
  - Tested independently
  - Deployed independently
  - Demonstrated to users independently
-->

### User Story 1 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P1)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently - e.g., "Can be fully tested by [specific action] and delivers [specific value]"]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]
2. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 2 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P2)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

### User Story 3 - [Brief Title] (Priority: P3)

[Describe this user journey in plain language]

**Why this priority**: [Explain the value and why it has this priority level]

**Independent Test**: [Describe how this can be tested independently]

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** [initial state], **When** [action], **Then** [expected outcome]

---

[Add more user stories as needed, each with an assigned priority]

### Edge Cases

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right edge cases.
-->

- What happens when [boundary condition]?
- How does system handle [error scenario]?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: The content in this section represents placeholders.
  Fill them out with the right functional requirements.
-->

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "allow users to create accounts"]
- **FR-002**: System MUST [specific capability, e.g., "validate email addresses"]  
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to [key interaction, e.g., "reset their password"]
- **FR-004**: System MUST [data requirement, e.g., "persist user preferences"]
- **FR-005**: System MUST [behavior, e.g., "log all security events"]

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*

- **FR-006**: System MUST authenticate users via [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: auth method not specified - email/password, SSO, OAuth?]
- **FR-007**: System MUST retain user data for [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: retention period not specified]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **[Entity 1]**: [What it represents, key attributes without implementation]
- **[Entity 2]**: [What it represents, relationships to other entities]

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Define measurable success criteria.
  These must be technology-agnostic and measurable.
-->

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "Users can complete account creation in under 2 minutes"]
- **SC-002**: [Measurable metric, e.g., "System handles 1000 concurrent users without degradation"]
- **SC-003**: [User satisfaction metric, e.g., "90% of users successfully complete primary task on first attempt"]
- **SC-004**: [Business metric, e.g., "Reduce support tickets related to [X] by 50%"]

# Tasks: [FEATURE NAME]

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/[###-feature-name]/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md (required), spec.md (required for user stories), research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: The examples below include test tasks. Tests are OPTIONAL - only include them if explicitly requested in the feature specification.

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/`, `tests/` at repository root
- **Web app**: `backend/src/`, `frontend/src/`
- **Mobile**: `api/src/`, `ios/src/` or `android/src/`
- Paths shown below assume single project - adjust based on plan.md structure

<!-- 
  ============================================================================
  IMPORTANT: The tasks below are SAMPLE TASKS for illustration purposes only.
  
  The /speckit.tasks command MUST replace these with actual tasks based on:
  - User stories from spec.md (with their priorities P1, P2, P3...)
  - Feature requirements from plan.md
  - Entities from data-model.md
  - Endpoints from contracts/
  
  Tasks MUST be organized by user story so each story can be:
  - Implemented independently
  - Tested independently
  - Delivered as an MVP increment
  
  DO NOT keep these sample tasks in the generated tasks.md file.
  ============================================================================
-->

## Phase 1: Setup (Shared Infrastructure)

**Purpose**: Project initialization and basic structure

- [ ] T001 Create project structure per implementation plan
- [ ] T002 Initialize [language] project with [framework] dependencies
- [ ] T003 [P] Configure linting and formatting tools

---

## Phase 2: Foundational (Blocking Prerequisites)

**Purpose**: Core infrastructure that MUST be complete before ANY user story can be implemented

**⚠️ CRITICAL**: No user story work can begin until this phase is complete

Examples of foundational tasks (adjust based on your project):

- [ ] T004 Setup database schema and migrations framework
- [ ] T005 [P] Implement authentication/authorization framework
- [ ] T006 [P] Setup API routing and middleware structure
- [ ] T007 Create base models/entities that all stories depend on
- [ ] T008 Configure error handling and logging infrastructure
- [ ] T009 Setup environment configuration management

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

---

## Phase 3: User Story 1 - [Title] (Priority: P1) 🎯 MVP

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 1 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

> **NOTE: Write these tests FIRST, ensure they FAIL before implementation**

- [ ] T010 [P] [US1] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T011 [P] [US1] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 1

- [ ] T012 [P] [US1] Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py
- [ ] T013 [P] [US1] Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py
- [ ] T014 [US1] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py (depends on T012, T013)
- [ ] T015 [US1] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T016 [US1] Add validation and error handling
- [ ] T017 [US1] Add logging for user story 1 operations

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Story 1 should be fully functional and testable independently

---

## Phase 4: User Story 2 - [Title] (Priority: P2)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 2 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T018 [P] [US2] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T019 [P] [US2] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 2

- [ ] T020 [P] [US2] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T021 [US2] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T022 [US2] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py
- [ ] T023 [US2] Integrate with User Story 1 components (if needed)

**Checkpoint**: At this point, User Stories 1 AND 2 should both work independently

---

## Phase 5: User Story 3 - [Title] (Priority: P3)

**Goal**: [Brief description of what this story delivers]

**Independent Test**: [How to verify this story works on its own]

### Tests for User Story 3 (OPTIONAL - only if tests requested) ⚠️

- [ ] T024 [P] [US3] Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py
- [ ] T025 [P] [US3] Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py

### Implementation for User Story 3

- [ ] T026 [P] [US3] Create [Entity] model in src/models/[entity].py
- [ ] T027 [US3] Implement [Service] in src/services/[service].py
- [ ] T028 [US3] Implement [endpoint/feature] in src/[location]/[file].py

**Checkpoint**: All user stories should now be independently functional

---

[Add more user story phases as needed, following the same pattern]

---

## Phase N: Polish & Cross-Cutting Concerns

**Purpose**: Improvements that affect multiple user stories

- [ ] TXXX [P] Documentation updates in docs/
- [ ] TXXX Code cleanup and refactoring
- [ ] TXXX Performance optimization across all stories
- [ ] TXXX [P] Additional unit tests (if requested) in tests/unit/
- [ ] TXXX Security hardening
- [ ] TXXX Run quickstart.md validation

---

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3+)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User stories can then proceed in parallel (if staffed)
  - Or sequentially in priority order (P1 → P2 → P3)
- **Polish (Final Phase)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - No dependencies on other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1 but should be independently testable
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Can start after Foundational (Phase 2) - May integrate with US1/US2 but should be independently testable

### Within Each User Story

- Tests (if included) MUST be written and FAIL before implementation
- Models before services
- Services before endpoints
- Core implementation before integration
- Story complete before moving to next priority

### Parallel Opportunities

- All Setup tasks marked [P] can run in parallel
- All Foundational tasks marked [P] can run in parallel (within Phase 2)
- Once Foundational phase completes, all user stories can start in parallel (if team capacity allows)
- All tests for a user story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Models within a story marked [P] can run in parallel
- Different user stories can be worked on in parallel by different team members

---

## Parallel Example: User Story 1

```bash
# Launch all tests for User Story 1 together (if tests requested):
Task: "Contract test for [endpoint] in tests/contract/test_[name].py"
Task: "Integration test for [user journey] in tests/integration/test_[name].py"

# Launch all models for User Story 1 together:
Task: "Create [Entity1] model in src/models/[entity1].py"
Task: "Create [Entity2] model in src/models/[entity2].py"
```

---

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (CRITICAL - blocks all stories)
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Test User Story 1 independently
5. Deploy/demo if ready

### Incremental Delivery

1. Complete Setup + Foundational → Foundation ready
2. Add User Story 1 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo (MVP!)
3. Add User Story 2 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
4. Add User Story 3 → Test independently → Deploy/Demo
5. Each story adds value without breaking previous stories

### Parallel Team Strategy

With multiple developers:

1. Team completes Setup + Foundational together
2. Once Foundational is done:
   - Developer A: User Story 1
   - Developer B: User Story 2
   - Developer C: User Story 3
3. Stories complete and integrate independently

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story for traceability
- Each user story should be independently completable and testable
- Verify tests fail before implementing
- Commit after each task or logical group
- Stop at any checkpoint to validate story independently
- Avoid: vague tasks, same file conflicts, cross-story dependencies that break independence

# AgentReady Self-Assessment

This directory contains the AgentReady tool's own assessment reports, demonstrating the output formats and serving as a reference implementation.

## Assessment Results

**Date**: 2025-11-21
**Score**: 75.4/100
**Certification Level**: 🥇 Gold

### Summary

- **Attributes Assessed**: 10/25
- **Attributes Skipped**: 15 (not yet implemented)
- **Duration**: 0.2 seconds

### Passing Attributes (7)

1. ✅ **CLAUDE.md File** (Tier 1, 10%) - Present and comprehensive
2. ✅ **README Structure** (Tier 1, 10%) - Well-structured documentation
3. ✅ **Type Annotations** (Tier 1, 10%) - Python type hints coverage
4. ✅ **Standard Layout** (Tier 2, 3%) - Follows src/ layout convention
5. ✅ **Test Coverage** (Tier 2, 3%) - Pytest suite with unit and integration tests
6. ✅ **Gitignore Completeness** (Tier 2, 3%) - Comprehensive .gitignore
7. ✅ **Cyclomatic Complexity** (Tier 3, 1.5%) - Low complexity in codebase

### Failing Attributes (3)

1. ❌ **Lock Files** (Tier 2, 3%) - No lock file present (intentional for library)
2. ❌ **Pre-commit Hooks** (Tier 2, 3%) - No .pre-commit-config.yaml
3. ❌ **Conventional Commits** (Tier 3, 1.5%) - Not enforced via tooling

### Not Applicable (15)

These attributes are stub implementations returning "not_applicable" - they will be implemented in future iterations.

## Report Formats

This directory contains three report formats generated by AgentReady:

### 1. JSON Report (`assessment-20251121.json`)

Machine-readable format for:
- CI/CD integration
- Programmatic processing
- Historical tracking
- Trend analysis

**Use Case**: Parse assessment data in automation scripts or dashboards.

### 2. HTML Report (`report-20251121.html`)

Interactive web report with:
- 🎨 Color-coded certification levels
- 🔍 Search and filter functionality
- 📊 Visual score indicators
- 📋 Collapsible finding details
- 🌐 Works offline (no CDN dependencies)

**Use Case**: Share with stakeholders or view in browser for detailed analysis.

**To view**: Open `report-20251121.html` in any web browser.

### 3. Markdown Report (`report-20251121.md`)

Version-control friendly format with:
- 📝 GitHub-Flavored Markdown
- ✅ Status indicators (✅❌⊘)
- 📊 ASCII tables
- 🎖️ Certification ladder
- 🔧 Prioritized next steps

**Use Case**: Commit to git for tracking improvements over time.

**To view**: View on GitHub or any Markdown renderer.

## How to Run Your Own Assessment

```bash
# Install AgentReady
pip install agentready

# Run assessment on current directory
agentready assess .

# Run with verbose output
agentready assess . --verbose

# Specify output directory
agentready assess /path/to/repo --output-dir ./reports
```

## Next Steps for AgentReady Repository

Based on this assessment, the highest-priority improvements are:

1. **Add Pre-commit Hooks** (+3 points) - Create `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with formatters and linters
2. **Enforce Conventional Commits** (+1.5 points) - Add commitlint to pre-commit hooks

These two changes would bring the score from **75.4** to **79.9** (still Gold, but closer to Platinum threshold of 90).

## About This Assessment

This self-assessment demonstrates:

- ✅ The tool successfully assesses itself
- ✅ All three report formats are generated
- ✅ Assessment completes in under 1 second
- ✅ Provides actionable remediation guidance
- ✅ Accurately reflects repository state

The fact that AgentReady achieves **Gold certification** when assessing itself validates that the scoring algorithm and attribute definitions are reasonable and achievable for real-world repositories.

# Remediation A1: Proportional Scoring Formula

**Issue**: FR-014 mentions proportional scoring but doesn't define the algorithm.

**Target File**: `specs/001-agentready-scorer/research.md`

**Action**: Add new section after existing technical decisions (after Decision 10)

---

## Content to Add

### Decision 11: Proportional Scoring Algorithm

**Context**: Many attributes have measurable thresholds that can be partially met (e.g., 65% test coverage when 80% is required). Linear proportional scoring provides deterministic, understandable results.

**Decision**: Use linear proportional scoring with the following formula:

```python
def calculate_proportional_score(measured_value, threshold, attribute_type):
    """
    Calculate proportional score for partial compliance.

    Args:
        measured_value: The measured value (numeric or parseable)
        threshold: The target threshold
        attribute_type: 'higher_is_better' or 'lower_is_better'

    Returns:
        Score from 0-100
    """
    if attribute_type == 'higher_is_better':
        # Example: test coverage (want higher values)
        if measured_value >= threshold:
            return 100
        elif measured_value <= 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return (measured_value / threshold) * 100

    elif attribute_type == 'lower_is_better':
        # Example: file length (want lower values)
        if measured_value <= threshold:
            return 100
        elif threshold == 0:
            return 0  # Avoid division by zero
        else:
            # Degrade linearly, cap at 0
            return max(0, 100 - ((measured_value - threshold) / threshold) * 100)
```

**Edge Cases**:
- Division by zero: Return 0 score
- Negative values: Clamp to 0
- Values exceeding 2x threshold (lower_is_better): Cap at 0
- Values exceeding 2x threshold (higher_is_better): Cap at 100

**Examples**:
- Test coverage: 65% measured, 80% threshold → 65/80 * 100 = 81.25 score
- File length: 450 lines measured, 300 threshold → 100 - ((450-300)/300)*100 = 50 score
- Cyclomatic complexity: 5 measured, 10 threshold → 100 (meets threshold)

**Rationale**: Linear proportional scoring is:
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and explain to users
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Fair**: Provides clear incentives for incremental improvement
- **Predictable**: Users can calculate expected score changes

Non-linear scoring (exponential penalties, sigmoid curves) was considered but rejected due to complexity and reduced transparency.

**References**:
- Spec FR-014: "Tool MUST handle repositories that partially meet attribute criteria"
- Spec FR-027: "Tool MUST calculate overall score based only on successfully evaluated attributes"
- Research report: All 25 attributes have quantifiable thresholds

# Remediation A2: Tier-Based Weight Distribution

**Issue**: FR-031 references tier-based weighting but doesn't specify the distribution.

**Target File**: `specs/001-agentready-scorer/data-model.md`

**Action**: Add new section after entities section

## Content to Add

## Weight Distribution

### Default Tier-Based Weights

Per FR-031, attributes are weighted by tier priority with heavy penalties for missing essentials (especially CLAUDE.md). Tier 1 (Essential) attributes have 8x the impact of Tier 4 (Advanced) attributes.

| Tier | Description | Total Weight | Attributes | Weight Per Attribute |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Tier 1 | Essential | 50% | 5 attributes | 10.0% each |
| Tier 2 | Critical | 30% | 10 attributes | 3.0% each |
| Tier 3 | Important | 15% | 5 attributes | 3.0% each |
| Tier 4 | Advanced | 5% | 5 attributes | 1.0% each |

**Total**: 100% across 25 attributes

**Penalty Philosophy**: Missing Tier 1 essentials (especially CLAUDE.md at 10%) creates significant score impact, incentivizing foundational improvements before advanced optimizations.

### Attribute-to-Tier Mapping

Based on research report tier assignments (lines 1535-1570):

**Tier 1 (Essential)** - 50% total weight (10% each):
1. CLAUDE.md Configuration Files (1.1) - **10.0%** ⚠️ CRITICAL
2. README Structure (2.1) - 10.0%
3. Type Annotations (3.3) - 10.0%
4. Standard Project Layouts (4.1) - 10.0%
5. Lock Files for Reproducibility (6.1) - 10.0%

**Tier 2 (Critical)** - 30% total weight (3% each):
6. Test Coverage Requirements (5.1) - 3.0%
7. Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD Linting (5.3) - 3.0%
8. Conventional Commit Messages (7.1) - 3.0%
9. .gitignore Completeness (7.2) - 3.0%
10. One-Command Build/Setup (8.1) - 3.0%
11. Concise Structured Documentation (1.2) - 3.0%
12. Inline Documentation (2.2) - 3.0%
13. File Size Limits (1.3) - 3.0%
14. Dependency Freshness & Security (6.2) - 3.0%
15. Separation of Concerns (4.2) - 3.0%

**Tier 3 (Important)** - 15% total weight (3% each):
16. Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds (3.1) - 3.0%
17. Structured Logging (9.2) - 3.0%
18. OpenAPI/Swagger Specifications (10.1) - 3.0%
19. Architecture Decision Records (2.3) - 3.0%
20. Semantic File & Directory Naming (11.3) - 3.0%

**Tier 4 (Advanced)** - 5% total weight (1% each):
21. Security Scanning Automation (13.1) - 1.0%
22. Performance Benchmarks (15.1) - 1.0%
23. Code Smell Elimination (3.4) - 1.0%
24. Issue & Pull Request Templates (7.3) - 1.0%
25. Container/Virtualization Setup (8.3) - 1.0%

### Custom Weight Configuration

Users can override default weights via `.agentready-config.yaml`:

```yaml
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.15          # Increase from 10% to 15% (org prioritizes CLAUDE.md)
  test_coverage: 0.05           # Increase from 3% to 5%
  conventional_commits: 0.01    # Decrease from 3% to 1%
  # ... other attributes use defaults, rescaled to sum to 1.0
```

**Validation** (per FR-033):
- All 25 attributes must be present (explicitly or via defaults)
- Weights must be positive numbers
- Weights must sum to 1.0 (±0.001 tolerance for floating point)
- Missing attributes inherit rescaled tier defaults

### Score Calculation Example

```python
overall_score = sum(
    attribute_score * weight
    for attribute_score, weight in zip(scores, weights)
    if attribute_status == 'assessed'  # Exclude skipped per FR-027
)

# Normalize if some attributes skipped
total_weight_assessed = sum(
    weight for weight, status in zip(weights, statuses)
    if status == 'assessed'
)
normalized_score = (overall_score / total_weight_assessed) * 100
```

**Example Scenario**:
- Repository missing CLAUDE.md: loses 10 points immediately
- Repository with CLAUDE.md but no tests: scores 10 (CLAUDE.md) + 0 (tests)
- Perfect CLAUDE.md + perfect tests = 10 + 3 = 13 points from just 2 attributes

### Configuration Precedence

When weights exist in multiple locations:

1. **CLI flags** (highest priority) - `--weight claude_md_file=0.15`
2. **Config file** - `.agentready-config.yaml`
3. **Tier defaults** (lowest priority) - Built-in distribution

**Rationale**: Tier-based distribution with heavy penalties for missing essentials ensures:
- Users prioritize foundational improvements (CLAUDE.md, README, types)
- Missing CLAUDE.md (10% weight) has 10x impact of missing container setup (1% weight)
- Aligns with research report's "Essential → Advanced" priority guidance
- Steep gradient incentivizes completing Tier 1 before moving to advanced features

# Remediation U1: Research Report Update Mechanism

**Issue**: FR-023 requires update capability but doesn't specify the mechanism.

**Target File**: `specs/001-agentready-scorer/plan.md`

**Action**: Add subsection under "## Technical Context"

---

## Content to Add

### Research Report Update Mechanism

**Per FR-023**: Tool must support updating the bundled research report.

**Versioning Philosophy**: agentready releases are bundled with a specific research report version. The tool and research report are versioned together (e.g., agentready v1.2.0 includes research report v1.2.0).

**Implementation Design**:

1. **Bundled Report**:
   - Research report shipped with tool installation in `src/agentready/data/agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md`
   - Tool version and research version always match in releases
   - Users can always rely on stable, tested research content

2. **Custom Research Reports**:
   - Users can point to custom research reports:
     ```bash
     agentready --research-file /path/to/custom-research.md
     agentready --research-file https://example.com/custom-research.md
     ```
   - Enables organizations to customize criteria for internal standards
   - Custom reports must pass validation (per FR-024)

3. **Update Command** (explicit opt-in only):
   ```bash
   agentready --update-research
   ```

4. **Update Source**:
   - Primary: `https://github.com/ambient-code/agentready/raw/main/src/agentready/data/agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md`
   - Downloads latest research report from main branch
   - User explicitly opts in to update

5. **Update Process** (atomic):
   ```
   a. Download new version to temp file
   b. Validate structure (per FR-024):
      - Check for required metadata (version, date)
      - Verify 25 attributes present
      - Validate Markdown format
      - Parse successfully with research_loader.py
   c. If valid:
      - Backup current: agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md → .md.backup
      - Atomic rename: temp → agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md
      - Remove backup on success
      - Display: "Updated research report from vX.Y.Z to vA.B.C"
   d. If invalid:
      - Delete temp file
      - Restore from backup if needed
      - Exit with error message and validation details
      - Keep current version intact
   ```

6. **Version Tracking**:
   - Research report includes metadata header:
     ```markdown
     ---
     version: 1.2.0
     date: 2025-11-20
     ---
     ```
   - Tool displays current research version:
     ```bash
     agentready --research-version
     # Output: Research report v1.2.0 (2025-11-20)
     ```

7. **Offline Behavior**:
   - If network unavailable: "Cannot reach update server. Using bundled version v1.0.0"
   - If update fails: "Update failed (validation error). Using current version v1.0.0"
   - Never leave tool in broken state
   - Always fall back to last known-good version

8. **Rollback**:
   ```bash
   agentready --restore-bundled-research  # Restore original from package
   ```
   - Restores research report from tool installation package
   - Useful if custom/updated research causes issues

**Error Handling**:
- Network timeout (30s): Graceful failure, keep current version
- Invalid format: Detailed validation error, rollback to previous
- Permission denied: Error with instructions to check file permissions
- Partial download: Checksum validation, retry or abort

**Testing** (integration test):
- Mock HTTP server with valid/invalid research reports
- Verify atomic updates (no partial writes)
- Test rollback on validation failure
- Confirm offline graceful degradation
- Verify version detection and display

**Philosophy**: Research report updates are explicitly opt-in only via `--update-research`. Standard workflow uses stable bundled version. Users who want latest research or custom criteria can update or override as needed.

- ⚠️ Missing categories identified (warning only)

### 5. References Section (REQUIRED)

```markdown
## REFERENCES & CITATIONS

[Consolidated bibliography]
```

**Validation**:
- ✅ References section exists
- ✅ At least 20 unique citations (evidence-based design threshold)
- ⚠️ URLs are reachable (check via HEAD request, warn only if unreachable)

## Validation Severity

**ERRORS** (block usage - report must be fixed):
- Missing metadata header
- Invalid version/date format
- Incorrect attribute count (not 25)
- Missing "Measurable Criteria" in any attribute
- Fewer than 4 tiers defined
- Attributes not assigned to tiers

**WARNINGS** (allow usage - non-critical issues):
- Missing "Impact on Agent Behavior" sections
- Fewer than 20 references
- Unreachable citation URLs
- Unbalanced tier distribution
- Missing category coverage

## Validation Implementation

```python
class ResearchReportValidator:
    def validate(self, content: str) -> ValidationResult:
        errors = []
        warnings = []

        # Parse metadata
        metadata = self._extract_metadata(content)
        if not metadata:
            errors.append("Missing metadata header with version and date")
        elif not self._is_valid_semver(metadata.get('version')):
            errors.append(f"Invalid version format: {metadata.get('version')}")

        # Count attributes
        attributes = self._extract_attributes(content)
        if len(attributes) != 25:
            errors.append(f"Expected 25 attributes, found {len(attributes)}")

        # Check measurable criteria
        for attr in attributes:
            if not attr.measurable_criteria:
                errors.append(f"Missing measurable criteria for {attr.name}")
            if not attr.impact_on_agent:
                warnings.append(f"Missing 'Impact on Agent Behavior' for {attr.name}")

        # Check tier assignments
        tiers = self._extract_tiers(content)
        if len(tiers) < 4:
            errors.append(f"Expected 4 tiers, found {len(tiers)}")

        # Check references
        refs = self._extract_references(content)
        if len(refs) < 20:
            warnings.append(f"Only {len(refs)} references (recommend 20+ for evidence-based design)")

        return ValidationResult(
            valid=len(errors) == 0,
            errors=errors,
            warnings=warnings
        )
```

## Example Validation Output

# Remediation U3: Weight Validation Rules

**Issue**: FR-033 requires weight validation but doesn't define the rules.

**Target File**: `specs/001-agentready-scorer/data-model.md`

**Action**: Add subsection after the Weight Distribution section

---

## Content to Add

## Configuration Weight Validation

**Per FR-033**: Custom weights in `.agentready-config.yaml` must be validated.

### Validation Rules

#### Rule 1: Completeness
All 25 attributes must have weights (explicit or inherited):

```python
REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES = [
    'claude_md_file', 'concise_documentation', 'file_size_limits',
    'readme_structure', 'inline_documentation', 'architecture_decisions',
    'cyclomatic_complexity', 'function_length', 'type_annotations',
    'code_smells', 'standard_layout', 'separation_concerns',
    'test_coverage', 'test_naming', 'precommit_hooks',
    'lock_files', 'dependency_freshness', 'conventional_commits',
    'gitignore_completeness', 'issue_pr_templates', 'one_command_setup',
    'dev_env_docs', 'container_setup', 'error_clarity',
    'structured_logging', 'openapi_specs', 'graphql_schemas',
    'dry_principle', 'naming_conventions', 'semantic_naming',
    'cicd_visibility', 'branch_protection', 'security_scanning',
    'secrets_management', 'performance_benchmarks'
]

def validate_completeness(config_weights, default_weights):
    missing = [
        attr for attr in REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
        if attr not in config_weights and attr not in default_weights
    ]
    if missing:
        raise ValidationError(f"Missing weights for: {', '.join(missing)}")
```

#### Rule 2: Positive Values
All weights must be positive numbers:

```python
def validate_positive(weights):
    invalid = {attr: w for attr, w in weights.items() if w <= 0}
    if invalid:
        raise ValidationError(f"Weights must be positive: {invalid}")
```

#### Rule 3: Sum Constraint
Weights must sum to 1.0 within floating-point tolerance:

```python
TOLERANCE = 0.001  # Allow 0.1% rounding error

def validate_sum(weights):
    total = sum(weights.values())
    if abs(total - 1.0) > TOLERANCE:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"Weights must sum to 1.0 (got {total:.4f}). "
            f"Difference: {total - 1.0:+.4f}"
        )
```

#### Rule 4: Reasonable Bounds
Individual weights should be between 0.5% and 20% (warnings only):

```python
MIN_WEIGHT = 0.005  # 0.5%
MAX_WEIGHT = 0.20   # 20%

def validate_bounds(weights):
    warnings = []
    for attr, weight in weights.items():
        if weight < MIN_WEIGHT:
            warnings.append(f"{attr}: {weight:.1%} is very low (< 0.5%)")
        if weight > MAX_WEIGHT:
            warnings.append(f"{attr}: {weight:.1%} is very high (> 20%)")
    return warnings  # Non-blocking warnings
```

### Partial Configuration Handling

Users can specify only overrides, inheriting defaults for others:

```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml (partial configuration)
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.15      # Override Tier 1 default (10%)
  test_coverage: 0.05       # Override Tier 2 default (3%)
  # Other 23 attributes: inherit rescaled tier defaults
```

**Rescaling Algorithm**:

```python
def merge_and_rescale(config_weights, tier_defaults):
    """
    Merge config overrides with tier defaults, then rescale to sum to 1.0.

    Args:
        config_weights: User-specified weights (partial or complete)
        tier_defaults: Default tier-based weights (complete, sums to 1.0)

    Returns:
        Final weights dictionary (complete, sums to 1.0)
    """
    # Start with tier defaults
    final_weights = tier_defaults.copy()

    # Override with config values
    final_weights.update(config_weights)

    # Rescale to sum to 1.0
    total = sum(final_weights.values())
    rescaled = {attr: w / total for attr, w in final_weights.items()}

    return rescaled

# Example:
# config = {'claude_md_file': 0.15, 'test_coverage': 0.05}
# defaults = {25 attributes summing to 1.0}
# After merge: sum = 1.07 (overrides increased total by 0.07)
# After rescale: all weights * (1.0 / 1.07) ≈ 0.935x scaling factor
```

### Validation Command

```bash
agentready --validate-config [path/to/config.yaml]
```

**Output Example**:

```
Validating config: .agentready-config.yaml

✓ All 25 attributes have weights
✓ All weights are positive
✓ Weights sum to 1.0000 (within tolerance)
⚠ claude_md_file: 15.0% is high (default: 10.0%, tier 1 average: 10.0%)
⚠ test_coverage: 5.0% is high (default: 3.0%, tier 2 average: 3.0%)

Configuration: VALID with 2 warnings

Effective weights after rescaling:
  claude_md_file: 14.02% (config: 15.0%, rescaled down)
  test_coverage: 4.67% (config: 5.0%, rescaled down)
  conventional_commits: 2.80% (default: 3.0%, rescaled down)
  ... (22 more attributes)

Total: 100.00%
```

### Error Messages

**Invalid Sum**:
```
ERROR: Weights must sum to 1.0 (got 0.8500). Difference: -0.1500

Your weights total 85%. This suggests missing attributes or incorrect values.

Current distribution:
  Explicitly specified: 0.6500 (13 attributes)
  Using tier defaults: 0.2000 (12 attributes)

Suggestion: Either specify all 25 attributes explicitly, or let unspecified
attributes inherit tier defaults (which will be automatically rescaled).
```

**Negative Weight**:
```
ERROR: Weights must be positive: {'test_coverage': -0.05}

Negative weights are not allowed. Did you mean to reduce other weights instead?
```

**Missing Attributes**:
```
ERROR: Missing weights for: inline_documentation, architecture_decisions

All 25 attributes must have weights. Either:
1. Specify these attributes in your config, OR
2. Ensure they exist in default-weights.yaml

To see all required attributes:
  agentready --list-attributes
```

**Tolerance Exceeded**:
```
ERROR: Weights must sum to 1.0 (got 1.0025). Difference: +0.0025

Sum exceeds tolerance (±0.001). Likely due to rounding errors.

Suggestion: Reduce precision or adjust values. For example:
  claude_md_file: 0.100 (instead of 0.1003)
  test_coverage: 0.050 (instead of 0.0497)
```

### Validation Integration

- **On config load**: Automatic validation (fail fast on errors)
- **On manual validate**: Detailed report with warnings
- **On assessment run**: Validation errors block execution
- **On example generation**: `--generate-config` produces valid example with comments

### Configuration Precedence

**Precedence Order** (highest to lowest):

1. **CLI flags** - `agentready --weight claude_md_file=0.15`
2. **Config file** - `.agentready-config.yaml` in current directory
3. **Config file (alternate path)** - `agentready --config /path/to/config.yaml`
4. **Tier defaults** - Built-in `src/agentready/data/default-weights.yaml`

**Merging Rules**:
- CLI flags override config file weights
- Config file overrides tier defaults
- Unspecified attributes always inherit tier defaults
- Final weights always rescaled to sum to 1.0

**Example**:
```bash
# CLI flag takes precedence
agentready --config custom.yaml --weight claude_md_file=0.20

# Precedence:
# 1. claude_md_file = 0.20 (from CLI flag)
# 2. Other weights from custom.yaml (if present)
# 3. Remaining weights from tier defaults
# 4. All rescaled to sum to 1.0
```

# Specification Quality Checklist: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-11-20
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED

✓ **No implementation details**: Specification focuses on "what" not "how". Tool name and CLI interface are requirements, not implementation details.
✓ **User value focused**: All user stories describe value delivery (assessment, interactive reports, remediation guidance).
✓ **Non-technical language**: Uses domain terms (repository, assessment, attribute) accessible to stakeholders.
✓ **Complete sections**: User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria all fully populated.

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED

✓ **No clarification markers**: All requirements are specific and concrete, no [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present.
✓ **Testable requirements**: Each FR can be verified (e.g., FR-003 "evaluate all 25 attributes" is verifiable by counting evaluated attributes).
✓ **Measurable success criteria**: All SC include specific metrics (e.g., SC-001 "<5 minutes for <10k files", SC-002 ">95% accuracy").
✓ **Technology-agnostic criteria**: Success criteria describe outcomes without specifying technologies (e.g., SC-008 focuses on user action time, not specific UI framework).
✓ **Complete acceptance scenarios**: All user stories include Given/When/Then scenarios covering happy paths.
✓ **Edge cases identified**: 8 edge cases documented covering error conditions, scale, and special repository types.
✓ **Clear scope**: Feature bounded to assessment and reporting, not extending to automated fixes or CI/CD integration.
✓ **Assumptions documented**: 8 assumptions listed covering access, permissions, audience, and operational constraints.

### Feature Readiness - PASSED

✓ **Clear acceptance criteria**: Each FR maps to acceptance scenarios in user stories (e.g., FR-005 dual-format reports → US1 acceptance scenario 5).
✓ **Primary flows covered**: 4 user stories progress from core value (scoring) through enhanced features (interactive HTML, remediation, version control).
✓ **Measurable outcomes**: 10 success criteria provide quantitative and qualitative validation points.
✓ **No implementation leakage**: No mention of specific frameworks, libraries, or technical architecture.

## Notes

**Validation Status**: ALL ITEMS PASSED ✓

Specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` command. No updates required.

**Strengths**:
- Comprehensive coverage of 25 attributes from research report
- Clear priority ordering (P1-P4) enabling MVP-first approach
- Well-defined success criteria with specific thresholds
- Extensive edge case consideration

**Ready for next phase**: Planning can proceed to define technical approach, architecture, and implementation strategy.

## JavaScript Functionality

### Required Interactive Features

1. **Filtering**
```javascript
// Filter attribute cards by status
function filterByStatus(status) {
    const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.finding-card');
    cards.forEach(card => {
        if (status === 'all' || card.dataset.status === status) {
            card.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            card.style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
    updateFilterCounts();
}
```

2. **Sorting**
```javascript
// Sort attributes by criteria
function sortAttributes(criteria) {
    const container = document.querySelector('.attribute-findings');
    const cards = Array.from(container.querySelectorAll('.finding-card'));

    cards.sort((a, b) => {
        if (criteria === 'score-asc') {
            return getScore(a) - getScore(b);
        } else if (criteria === 'score-desc') {
            return getScore(b) - getScore(a);
        } else if (criteria === 'tier') {
            return parseInt(a.dataset.tier) - parseInt(b.dataset.tier);
        }
        // Default: category order (no change)
        return 0;
    });

    cards.forEach(card => container.appendChild(card));
}
```

3. **Search**
```javascript
// Search attributes by text
function searchAttributes(query) {
    const lowercaseQuery = query.toLowerCase();
    const cards = document.querySelectorAll('.finding-card');

    cards.forEach(card => {
        const name = card.querySelector('.attribute-name').textContent.toLowerCase();
        const desc = card.querySelector('.finding-details').textContent.toLowerCase();

        if (name.includes(lowercaseQuery) || desc.includes(lowercaseQuery)) {
            card.style.display = 'block';
        } else {
            card.style.display = 'none';
        }
    });
}
```

4. **Smooth Scrolling**
```javascript
// Smooth scroll to category section
function scrollToCategory(categoryId) {
    const section = document.querySelector(`[data-category="${categoryId}"]`);
    section.scrollIntoView({ behavior: 'smooth', block: 'start' });
}
```

5. **Dynamic Progress Circles**
```javascript
// Animate score circle on page load
function animateScoreCircle(element, targetScore) {
    let currentScore = 0;
    const duration = 1000; // 1 second
    const increment = targetScore / (duration / 16); // 60 FPS

    const interval = setInterval(() => {
        currentScore += increment;
        if (currentScore >= targetScore) {
            currentScore = targetScore;
            clearInterval(interval);
        }
        updateCircle(element, currentScore);
    }, 16);
}
```

#### 1.2 Concise Structured Documentation ⚠️

**Tier**: 1 (Essential)
**Score**: 60/100
**Status**: Needs Improvement

**Measured**: README 1247 lines
**Threshold**: <500 lines

**Evidence**:
- ⚠️ README exists but exceeds recommended size: `README.md` (1247 lines)
- ✅ Uses standard Markdown headings
- ⚠️ Missing table of contents for >100 line document

<details>
<summary>🔧 Remediation Steps</summary>

**Summary**: Split README into smaller, focused documents

**Steps**:

2. Create `docs/` directory for detailed documentation
3. Keep README focused on quickstart and overview
4. Add links to detailed docs from README
5. Add table of contents to README

**Tools Needed**:
- None (manual refactoring)

**Commands**:
```bash
mkdir -p docs/
# Move detailed sections to docs/api.md, docs/architecture.md, etc.
```

**References**:
- [Real Python: Documentation Best Practices](https://realpython.com/documenting-python-code/)

## Validation Implementation

```python
class ResearchReportValidator:
    def validate(self, content: str) -> ValidationResult:
        errors = []
        warnings = []

        # Parse metadata
        metadata = self._extract_metadata(content)
        if not metadata:
            errors.append("Missing metadata header with version and date")
        elif not self._is_valid_semver(metadata.get('version')):
            errors.append(f"Invalid version format: {metadata.get('version')}")

        # Count attributes
        attributes = self._extract_attributes(content)
        if len(attributes) != 25:
            errors.append(f"Expected 25 attributes, found {len(attributes)}")

        # Check measurable criteria
        for attr in attributes:
            if not attr.measurable_criteria:
                errors.append(f"Missing measurable criteria for {attr.name}")
            if not attr.impact_on_agent:
                warnings.append(f"Missing 'Impact on Agent Behavior' for {attr.name}")

        # Check tier assignments
        tiers = self._extract_tiers(content)
        if len(tiers) < 4:
            errors.append(f"Expected 4 tiers, found {len(tiers)}")

        # Check references
        refs = self._extract_references(content)
        if len(refs) < 20:
            warnings.append(f"Only {len(refs)} references (recommend 20+ for evidence-based design)")

        return ValidationResult(
            valid=len(errors) == 0,
            errors=errors,
            warnings=warnings
        )
```

## Example Validation Output

```

```

## Usage in Tool

```python
from agentready.services.research_loader import ResearchLoader

loader = ResearchLoader()
result = loader.load_and_validate('agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md')

if not result.valid:
    print("Research report validation FAILED:")
    for error in result.errors:
        print(f"  ❌ {error}")
    sys.exit(1)

if result.warnings:
    print("Research report validation warnings:")
    for warning in result.warnings:
        print(f"  ⚠️  {warning}")

# Proceed with valid research report
research = result.research

# Data Model: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Phase**: 1 - Data Modeling
**Date**: 2025-11-20
**Purpose**: Define entities, relationships, and validation rules for the assessment system

## Overview

The data model consists of 7 primary entities organized in a hierarchical assessment workflow:
`Repository` → `Assessment` → `Finding[]` → `Remediation`

All entities use Python dataclasses with type hints for clarity and validation.

## Entity Definitions

### 1. Repository

Represents the target git repository being assessed.

**Fields**:
- `path: pathlib.Path` - Absolute path to repository root
- `name: str` - Repository name (derived from path)
- `url: str | None` - Remote origin URL if available
- `branch: str` - Current branch name
- `commit_hash: str` - Current HEAD commit SHA
- `languages: dict[str, int]` - Detected languages with file counts (e.g., `{"Python": 42, "JavaScript": 18}`)
- `total_files: int` - Total files in repository (respecting .gitignore)
- `total_lines: int` - Total lines of code

**Validation Rules**:
- `path` must exist and contain `.git` directory
- `name` derived from `path.name`
- `languages` keys must be valid language names
- `total_files` and `total_lines` must be non-negative

**Relationships**:
- One Repository → One Assessment

**Example**:
```python
Repository(
    path=Path("/home/user/myproject"),
    name="myproject",
    url="https://github.com/user/myproject.git",
    branch="main",
    commit_hash="abc123def456",

Attribute(
    id="claude_md_file",
    name="CLAUDE.md Configuration Files",
    category="Context Window Optimization",
    tier=1,
    description="Markdown file at repository root for Claude Code context",
    criteria="File exists, <1000 lines, contains required sections",
    default_weight=0.08
)
```

- `score` required if status="pass" or status="fail", otherwise None
- `score` must be in range [0.0, 100.0] if present
- `error_message` required if status="error"

**Status Meanings**:
- `pass`: Attribute meets criteria (score typically 70-100)
- `fail`: Attribute doesn't meet criteria (score typically 0-69)
- `skipped`: Attribute couldn't be assessed (missing tool, permission error)
- `error`: Unexpected error during assessment
- `not_applicable`: Attribute doesn't apply to this repository (e.g., language-specific check)

**Relationships**:
- Many Findings → One Assessment
- Many Findings → One Attribute

**Example**:
```python
Finding(
    attribute=Attribute(...),
    status="fail",
    score=40.0,

    summary="Split large_module.py into smaller modules",
    steps=[
        "Identify logical groupings within large_module.py",
        "Extract each grouping into separate module",
        "Update imports in dependent files",
        "Verify tests still pass"
    ],
    tools=["radon"],
    commands=["radon cc src/large_module.py -a"],

    },
    excluded_attributes=["performance_benchmarks"],
    language_overrides={"Python": ["*.pyx"]},
    output_dir=Path("/custom/reports")
)
```

---

## Weight Distribution

### Default Tier-Based Weights

Per FR-031, attributes are weighted by tier priority with heavy penalties for missing essentials (especially CLAUDE.md). Tier 1 (Essential) attributes have 10x the impact of Tier 4 (Advanced) attributes.

| Tier | Description | Total Weight | Attributes | Weight Per Attribute |
|------|-------------|--------------|------------|---------------------|
| Tier 1 | Essential | 50% | 5 attributes | 10.0% each |
| Tier 2 | Critical | 30% | 10 attributes | 3.0% each |
| Tier 3 | Important | 15% | 5 attributes | 3.0% each |
| Tier 4 | Advanced | 5% | 5 attributes | 1.0% each |

**Total**: 100% across 25 attributes

**Penalty Philosophy**: Missing Tier 1 essentials (especially CLAUDE.md at 10%) creates significant score impact, incentivizing foundational improvements before advanced optimizations.

### Attribute-to-Tier Mapping

Based on research report tier assignments (lines 1535-1570):

**Tier 1 (Essential)** - 50% total weight (10% each):
1. CLAUDE.md Configuration Files (1.1) - **10.0%** ⚠️ CRITICAL
2. README Structure (2.1) - 10.0%
3. Type Annotations (3.3) - 10.0%
4. Standard Project Layouts (4.1) - 10.0%
5. Lock Files for Reproducibility (6.1) - 10.0%

**Tier 2 (Critical)** - 30% total weight (3% each):
6. Test Coverage Requirements (5.1) - 3.0%
7. Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD Linting (5.3) - 3.0%
8. Conventional Commit Messages (7.1) - 3.0%
9. .gitignore Completeness (7.2) - 3.0%
10. One-Command Build/Setup (8.1) - 3.0%
11. Concise Structured Documentation (1.2) - 3.0%
12. Inline Documentation (2.2) - 3.0%
13. File Size Limits (1.3) - 3.0%
14. Dependency Freshness & Security (6.2) - 3.0%
15. Separation of Concerns (4.2) - 3.0%

**Tier 3 (Important)** - 15% total weight (3% each):
16. Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds (3.1) - 3.0%
17. Structured Logging (9.2) - 3.0%
18. OpenAPI/Swagger Specifications (10.1) - 3.0%
19. Architecture Decision Records (2.3) - 3.0%
20. Semantic File & Directory Naming (11.3) - 3.0%

**Tier 4 (Advanced)** - 5% total weight (1% each):
21. Security Scanning Automation (13.1) - 1.0%
22. Performance Benchmarks (15.1) - 1.0%
23. Code Smell Elimination (3.4) - 1.0%
24. Issue & Pull Request Templates (7.3) - 1.0%
25. Container/Virtualization Setup (8.3) - 1.0%

### Custom Weight Configuration

Users can override default weights via `.agentready-config.yaml`:

```yaml
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.15          # Increase from 10% to 15% (org prioritizes CLAUDE.md)
  test_coverage: 0.05           # Increase from 3% to 5%
  conventional_commits: 0.01    # Decrease from 3% to 1%
  # ... other attributes use defaults, rescaled to sum to 1.0
```

**Validation** (per FR-033):
- All 25 attributes must be present (explicitly or via defaults)
- Weights must be positive numbers
- Weights must sum to 1.0 (±0.001 tolerance for floating point)
- Missing attributes inherit rescaled tier defaults

### Score Calculation Example

```python
overall_score = sum(
    attribute_score * weight
    for attribute_score, weight in zip(scores, weights)
    if attribute_status == 'assessed'  # Exclude skipped per FR-027
)

# Normalize if some attributes skipped
total_weight_assessed = sum(
    weight for weight, status in zip(weights, statuses)
    if status == 'assessed'
)
normalized_score = (overall_score / total_weight_assessed) * 100
```

**Example Scenario**:
- Repository missing CLAUDE.md: loses 10 points immediately
- Repository with CLAUDE.md but no tests: scores 10 (CLAUDE.md) + 0 (tests)
- Perfect CLAUDE.md + perfect tests = 10 + 3 = 13 points from just 2 attributes

### Configuration Precedence

When weights exist in multiple locations:

1. **CLI flags** (highest priority) - `--weight claude_md_file=0.15`
2. **Config file** - `.agentready-config.yaml`
3. **Tier defaults** (lowest priority) - Built-in distribution

**Rationale**: Tier-based distribution with heavy penalties for missing essentials ensures:
- Users prioritize foundational improvements (CLAUDE.md, README, types)
- Missing CLAUDE.md (10% weight) has 10x impact of missing container setup (1% weight)
- Aligns with research report's "Essential → Advanced" priority guidance
- Steep gradient incentivizes completing Tier 1 before moving to advanced features

---

## Configuration Weight Validation

**Per FR-033**: Custom weights in `.agentready-config.yaml` must be validated.

### Validation Rules

#### Rule 1: Completeness
All 25 attributes must have weights (explicit or inherited):

```python
REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES = [
    'claude_md_file', 'concise_documentation', 'file_size_limits',
    'readme_structure', 'inline_documentation', 'architecture_decisions',
    'cyclomatic_complexity', 'function_length', 'type_annotations',
    'code_smells', 'standard_layout', 'separation_concerns',

def validate_completeness(config_weights, default_weights):
    missing = [
        attr for attr in REQUIRED_ATTRIBUTES
        if attr not in config_weights and attr not in default_weights
    ]
    if missing:
        raise ValidationError(f"Missing weights for: {', '.join(missing)}")
```

#### Rule 2: Positive Values
All weights must be positive numbers:

```python
def validate_positive(weights):
    invalid = {attr: w for attr, w in weights.items() if w <= 0}
    if invalid:
        raise ValidationError(f"Weights must be positive: {invalid}")
```

#### Rule 3: Sum Constraint
Weights must sum to 1.0 within floating-point tolerance:

```python
TOLERANCE = 0.001  # Allow 0.1% rounding error

def validate_sum(weights):
    total = sum(weights.values())
    if abs(total - 1.0) > TOLERANCE:
        raise ValidationError(
            f"Weights must sum to 1.0 (got {total:.4f}). "
            f"Difference: {total - 1.0:+.4f}"
        )
```

#### Rule 4: Reasonable Bounds
Individual weights should be between 0.5% and 20% (warnings only):

```python
MIN_WEIGHT = 0.005  # 0.5%
MAX_WEIGHT = 0.20   # 20%

def validate_bounds(weights):
    warnings = []
    for attr, weight in weights.items():
        if weight < MIN_WEIGHT:
            warnings.append(f"{attr}: {weight:.1%} is very low (< 0.5%)")
        if weight > MAX_WEIGHT:
            warnings.append(f"{attr}: {weight:.1%} is very high (> 20%)")
    return warnings  # Non-blocking warnings
```

### Partial Configuration Handling

Users can specify only overrides, inheriting defaults for others:

```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml (partial configuration)
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.15      # Override Tier 1 default (10%)
  test_coverage: 0.05       # Override Tier 2 default (3%)
  # Other 23 attributes: inherit rescaled tier defaults
```

**Rescaling Algorithm**:

```python
def merge_and_rescale(config_weights, tier_defaults):
    """
    Merge config overrides with tier defaults, then rescale to sum to 1.0.

    Args:
        config_weights: User-specified weights (partial or complete)
        tier_defaults: Default tier-based weights (complete, sums to 1.0)

    Returns:
        Final weights dictionary (complete, sums to 1.0)
    """
    # Start with tier defaults
    final_weights = tier_defaults.copy()

    # Override with config values
    final_weights.update(config_weights)

    # Rescale to sum to 1.0
    total = sum(final_weights.values())
    rescaled = {attr: w / total for attr, w in final_weights.items()}

    return rescaled

# Example:
# config = {'claude_md_file': 0.15, 'test_coverage': 0.05}
# defaults = {25 attributes summing to 1.0}
# After merge: sum = 1.07 (overrides increased total by 0.07)
# After rescale: all weights * (1.0 / 1.07) ≈ 0.935x scaling factor
```

### Validation Command

```bash
agentready --validate-config [path/to/config.yaml]
```

**Output Example**:

```
Validating config: .agentready-config.yaml

✓ All 25 attributes have weights
✓ All weights are positive
✓ Weights sum to 1.0000 (within tolerance)
⚠ claude_md_file: 15.0% is high (default: 10.0%, tier 1 average: 10.0%)
⚠ test_coverage: 5.0% is high (default: 3.0%, tier 2 average: 3.0%)

Configuration: VALID with 2 warnings

Effective weights after rescaling:
  claude_md_file: 14.02% (config: 15.0%, rescaled down)
  test_coverage: 4.67% (config: 5.0%, rescaled down)
  conventional_commits: 2.80% (default: 3.0%, rescaled down)
  ... (22 more attributes)

Total: 100.00%
```

### Error Messages

**Invalid Sum**:
```
ERROR: Weights must sum to 1.0 (got 0.8500). Difference: -0.1500

Your weights total 85%. This suggests missing attributes or incorrect values.

Current distribution:
  Explicitly specified: 0.6500 (13 attributes)
  Using tier defaults: 0.2000 (12 attributes)

Suggestion: Either specify all 25 attributes explicitly, or let unspecified
attributes inherit tier defaults (which will be automatically rescaled).
```

**Negative Weight**:
```
ERROR: Weights must be positive: {'test_coverage': -0.05}

Negative weights are not allowed. Did you mean to reduce other weights instead?
```

**Missing Attributes**:
```
ERROR: Missing weights for: inline_documentation, architecture_decisions

All 25 attributes must have weights. Either:
1. Specify these attributes in your config, OR
2. Ensure they exist in default-weights.yaml

To see all required attributes:
  agentready --list-attributes
```

**Tolerance Exceeded**:
```
ERROR: Weights must sum to 1.0 (got 1.0025). Difference: +0.0025

Sum exceeds tolerance (±0.001). Likely due to rounding errors.

Suggestion: Reduce precision or adjust values. For example:
  claude_md_file: 0.100 (instead of 0.1003)
  test_coverage: 0.050 (instead of 0.0497)
```

### Validation Integration

- **On config load**: Automatic validation (fail fast on errors)
- **On manual validate**: Detailed report with warnings
- **On assessment run**: Validation errors block execution
- **On example generation**: `--generate-config` produces valid example with comments

### Configuration Precedence

**Precedence Order** (highest to lowest):

1. **CLI flags** - `agentready --weight claude_md_file=0.15`
2. **Config file** - `.agentready-config.yaml` in current directory
3. **Config file (alternate path)** - `agentready --config /path/to/config.yaml`
4. **Tier defaults** - Built-in `src/agentready/data/default-weights.yaml`

**Merging Rules**:
- CLI flags override config file weights
- Config file overrides tier defaults
- Unspecified attributes always inherit tier defaults
- Final weights always rescaled to sum to 1.0

**Example**:
```bash
# CLI flag takes precedence
agentready --config custom.yaml --weight claude_md_file=0.20

# Precedence:
# 1. claude_md_file = 0.20 (from CLI flag)
# 2. Other weights from custom.yaml (if present)
# 3. Remaining weights from tier defaults
# 4. All rescaled to sum to 1.0
```

## State Transitions

### Assessment Workflow

```
Repository → Validate → Detect Languages → Load Config → Create Assessment

For each Attribute:
    Create Assessor → Check Applicability

    if applicable:
        Execute Assessment → Create Finding
    else:
        Create Finding (status=not_applicable)

Calculate Overall Score → Determine Certification Level

Generate Reports → Save to Disk
```

### Finding Status Flow

```
                           ┌─────────────┐
                           │   Start     │

```

## Serialization

All entities must support JSON serialization for:
- Report generation (HTML/Markdown use JSON as intermediate format)
- Automation integration (tools consuming assessment data)
- Caching/persistence (save assessment results)

**Serialization Strategy**:
- Use `dataclasses.asdict()` with custom JSON encoder
- Convert `datetime` to ISO 8601 strings
- Convert `Path` to strings
- Convert enums to string values
- Preserve nested structures

**Example JSON Output**:
```json
{
  "repository": {
    "name": "myproject",
    "path": "/home/user/myproject",
    "languages": {"Python": 42},
    "total_files": 54
  },
  "timestamp": "2025-11-20T14:30:00",
  "overall_score": 72.5,
  "certification_level": "Silver",
  "findings": [
    {
      "attribute": {"id": "claude_md_file", "name": "CLAUDE.md"},
      "status": "pass",
      "score": 100.0,
      "evidence": ["CLAUDE.md exists (487 lines)"]
    }
  ]
}
```

---

## Summary

Data model defines 7 entities with clear responsibilities:
- `Repository`: What is being assessed
- `Attribute`: What is being measured
- `Assessment`: Container for complete evaluation
- `Finding`: Result of one attribute check
- `Remediation`: How to fix failures
- `Citation`: Supporting research
- `Config`: User customization

All validation rules enforced at model layer (fail fast). State transitions are linear (no complex workflows). JSON serialization supports all output formats and automation integrations.

# Implementation Plan: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Branch**: `001-agentready-scorer` | **Date**: 2025-11-20 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-agentready-scorer/spec.md`

**Note**: This template is filled in by the `/speckit.plan` command. See `.specify/templates/commands/plan.md` for the execution workflow.

## Summary

Build a command-line tool called "agentready" that assesses git repositories against 25 evidence-based attributes for AI-assisted development readiness. The tool analyzes repository quality across categories like documentation, code quality, testing, structure, CI/CD, and security, then generates dual-format reports (interactive HTML + version-control-friendly Markdown) with specific findings, evidence, remediation guidance, and an overall agent-readiness score with certification level (Platinum/Gold/Silver/Bronze).

Technical approach: Library-first architecture with standalone assessment modules for each attribute category, CLI wrapper orchestrating the scan workflow, bundled research data with update capability, and self-contained HTML report generation with embedded interactivity.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Python 3.11+ (only N and N-1 versions supported per constitution)
**Primary Dependencies**:
- Click (CLI framework)
- Jinja2 (HTML template rendering)
- PyYAML (configuration file parsing)
- gitpython (repository introspection)
- Language-specific analyzers: radon (Python complexity), lizard (multi-language complexity)

**Storage**: File-based (no database required)
- Bundled research report (agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md)
- Optional user configuration file (.agentready-config.yaml)
- Generated reports (.agentready/ directory)

**Testing**: pytest with pytest-cov for coverage tracking
- Unit tests for individual attribute assessors
- Integration tests for full scan workflows
- Contract tests for report schemas

**Target Platform**: Cross-platform CLI (Linux, macOS, Windows via Python)
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI tool with library modules)
**Performance Goals**:
- Complete assessment in <5 minutes for repositories with <10k files
- Deterministic scoring (consistent results across runs)
- Minimal memory footprint (<500MB for typical repositories)

**Constraints**:
- Offline-capable (internet only for research report updates)
- Self-contained HTML reports (no external CDN dependencies)
- Graceful degradation (partial results if some checks fail)
- No modification of scanned repository (read-only analysis)

**Scale/Scope**:
- 25 attribute assessors (one per research report attribute)
- Support 5+ programming languages (Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Go, Java minimum)
- Handle repositories up to 100k files (with performance degradation warning)

### Research Report Update Mechanism

**Per FR-023**: Tool must support updating the bundled research report.

**Versioning Philosophy**: agentready releases are bundled with a specific research report version. The tool and research report are versioned together (e.g., agentready v1.2.0 includes research report v1.2.0).

**Implementation Design**:

1. **Bundled Report**:
   - Research report shipped with tool installation in `src/agentready/data/agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md`
   - Tool version and research version always match in releases
   - Users can always rely on stable, tested research content

2. **Custom Research Reports**:
   - Users can point to custom research reports:
     ```bash
     agentready --research-file /path/to/custom-research.md
     agentready --research-file https://example.com/custom-research.md
     ```
   - Enables organizations to customize criteria for internal standards
   - Custom reports must pass validation (per FR-024)

3. **Update Command** (explicit opt-in only):
   ```bash
   agentready --update-research
   ```

4. **Update Source**:
   - Primary: `https://github.com/ambient-code/agentready/raw/main/src/agentready/data/agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md`
   - Downloads latest research report from main branch
   - User explicitly opts in to update

5. **Update Process** (atomic):
   ```
   a. Download new version to temp file
   b. Validate structure (per FR-024):
      - Check for required metadata (version, date)
      - Verify 25 attributes present
      - Validate Markdown format
      - Parse successfully with research_loader.py
   c. If valid:
      - Backup current: agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md → .md.backup
      - Atomic rename: temp → agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md
      - Remove backup on success
      - Display: "Updated research report from vX.Y.Z to vA.B.C"
   d. If invalid:
      - Delete temp file
      - Restore from backup if needed
      - Exit with error message and validation details
      - Keep current version intact
   ```

6. **Version Tracking**:
   - Research report includes metadata header:
     ```markdown
     ---
     version: 1.2.0
     date: 2025-11-20
     ---
     ```
   - Tool displays current research version:
     ```bash
     agentready --research-version
     # Output: Research report v1.2.0 (2025-11-20)
     ```

7. **Offline Behavior**:
   - If network unavailable: "Cannot reach update server. Using bundled version v1.0.0"
   - If update fails: "Update failed (validation error). Using current version v1.0.0"
   - Never leave tool in broken state
   - Always fall back to last known-good version

8. **Rollback**:
   ```bash
   agentready --restore-bundled-research  # Restore original from package
   ```
   - Restores research report from tool installation package
   - Useful if custom/updated research causes issues

**Error Handling**:
- Network timeout (30s): Graceful failure, keep current version
- Invalid format: Detailed validation error, rollback to previous
- Permission denied: Error with instructions to check file permissions
- Partial download: Checksum validation, retry or abort

**Testing** (integration test):
- Mock HTTP server with valid/invalid research reports
- Verify atomic updates (no partial writes)
- Test rollback on validation failure
- Confirm offline graceful degradation
- Verify version detection and display

**Philosophy**: Research report updates are explicitly opt-in only via `--update-research`. Standard workflow uses stable bundled version. Users who want latest research or custom criteria can update or override as needed.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

### Principle I: Evidence-Based Design
✅ **PASS** - All 25 attributes derived from agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md research report with 50+ authoritative citations. Every assessment criterion grounded in documented findings from Anthropic, Microsoft, Google, ArXiv, IEEE/ACM sources.

### Principle II: Measurable Quality
✅ **PASS** - Each attribute has:
- Clear criteria (e.g., "CLAUDE.md exists and <1000 lines", "test coverage >80%")
- Automated tooling specified (radon, pytest-cov, gitpython, lizard)
- Quantifiable thresholds from research report
- Good/bad examples in research report

### Principle III: Tool-First Mindset
✅ **PASS** - Architecture follows library-first approach:
- Standalone assessor modules (importable, independently testable)
- CLI wrapper as thin orchestration layer
- Text-based I/O (repository path in → JSON/Markdown/HTML out)
- Each assessor usable without full agentready toolchain

### Principle IV: Test-Driven Development
✅ **PASS** - TDD workflow planned:
- Phase 2 will generate test tasks BEFORE implementation tasks
- Contract tests for report schemas (validate structure)
- Integration tests for scan workflows
- Unit tests for each attribute assessor
- Test coverage >80% enforced

### Principle V: Structured Output
✅ **PASS** - Dual-format output design:
- HTML for human consumption (interactive, visual)
- Markdown for version control/automation (parseable, diffable)
- Internal JSON representation (structured data model)
- Structured logging with progress indicators
- Error messages with context and guidance (FR-030)

### Principle VI: Incremental Delivery
✅ **PASS** - User stories prioritized for MVP-first:
- P1 (MVP): Core scoring engine → Delivers immediate value
- P2: Interactive HTML features → Enhanced UX
- P3: Remediation guidance → Actionable next steps
- P4: Version control integration → Team collaboration
- Each story independently testable and deployable

### Principle VII: Documentation as Code
✅ **PASS** - Documentation strategy:
- README with <5 minute quickstart (generated in Phase 1)
- CLAUDE.md with project context (to be created)
- Inline docstrings explaining "why" (assessment rationale)
- Examples in quickstart.md
- Research report citations preserved in all outputs

**GATE STATUS**: ✅ ALL PRINCIPLES PASS - Proceed to Phase 0 research

**Structure Decision**: Single project (Option 1) selected. This is a CLI tool with library modules, not a web/mobile application. The structure follows Python src-layout convention with clear separation between CLI (thin wrapper), core logic (assessors, services, models), and output (reporters). Tests mirror source structure for easy navigation.

```bash
# Run assessment
agentready

# Make improvements to your repository
# (e.g., add CLAUDE.md, improve test coverage, add pre-commit hooks)

# Run assessment again
agentready

# Compare Markdown reports (they're git-friendly!)
git diff .agentready/report-2025-11-20T14-30-00.md .agentready/report-2025-11-20T16-45-00.md
```

### Commit Reports to Version Control

```bash
# Add reports to git for historical tracking
git add .agentready/report-*.md
git commit -m "docs: add agent-ready assessment (Silver, 72/100)"

# Include in pull requests to show improvements
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "Not a git repository" Error

```bash
Error: /path/to/directory is not a git repository (no .git directory found)
```

**Solution**: Ensure you're in a git repository root:
```bash
git init  # If needed
git status  # Verify
```

### Missing Tool Warnings

```bash
⏭️ Skipped: Cyclomatic Complexity (missing tool: radon)
```

**Solution**: Install missing language-specific tools:
```bash
# Python complexity analysis
pip install radon

# Multi-language complexity
pip install lizard

# Re-run assessment
agentready
```

### Slow Assessment (>5 minutes)

```bash
⚠️ Assessment took 8m 32s (expected <5m for <10k files)
```

**Causes**:
- Very large repository (>10k files)
- Slow disk I/O
- Many languages to analyze

**Solutions**:
- Use `--exclude` to skip vendor/generated directories
- Run on SSD for faster file scanning
- Consider assessing specific subdirectories

### Permission Errors

```bash
⏭️ Skipped: File Size Limits (permission denied: /protected/directory)
```

**Solution**: Ensure read access to all repository files or accept partial results (agentready continues with available data).

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review HTML Report**: Open `.agentready/report-latest.html` in browser
2. **Check Top Priorities**: Look at "Next Steps" section
3. **Make Improvements**: Start with Tier 1 (Essential) attributes
4. **Re-assess**: Run `agentready` again to see score improvement
5. **Track Progress**: Commit reports to git for historical comparison

# Research: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Phase**: 0 - Technical Research and Best Practices
**Date**: 2025-11-20
**Purpose**: Document technical decisions, rationale, and best practices for implementation

## 1. CLI Framework Selection

### Decision: Click

**Rationale**:
- Declarative command definition with decorators (clean, readable)
- Automatic help generation and input validation
- Native support for subcommands, options, and arguments
- Excellent error handling with user-friendly messages
- Wide adoption in Python CLI tools (pytest, pip, AWS CLI v2)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- `argparse` (stdlib): Too verbose, manual help text, basic validation
- `typer`: Type-hint based, but adds FastAPI dependency (unnecessary weight)
- `docopt`: String-based interface description (less type-safe)

**Best Practices**:
- Use `click.Path(exists=True, file_okay=False)` for repository path validation
- Implement `--verbose` with `click.option('--verbose', is_flag=True)`
- Use `click.echo()` for stdout (handles encoding across platforms)
- Use `click.secho()` for colored output (certification levels, progress)
- Implement progress bars with `click.progressbar()`

## 2. HTML Report Generation

### Decision: Jinja2 + Embedded CSS/JavaScript

**Rationale**:
- Jinja2 is industry-standard Python templating (Django, Flask)
- Template-based approach separates presentation from logic
- Easy to maintain and update report layout
- Embedding CSS/JS ensures offline functionality (FR-003)
- Single-file output simplifies distribution

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Direct HTML string building: Unmaintainable, error-prone
- WeasyPrint (HTML→PDF): Not required, HTML itself is deliverable
- React/Vue SPA: Requires build step, complex for static reports

**Best Practices**:
- Inline all CSS in `<style>` tag (avoid external stylesheets)
- Inline all JavaScript in `<script>` tag (no CDN dependencies)
- Use vanilla JavaScript (no jQuery/framework dependencies)
- Minify embedded CSS/JS for smaller file size
- Use CSS Grid/Flexbox for responsive layout (modern browser support)
- Implement collapsible sections with `<details>` and `<summary>` tags (native HTML5)
- Add `data-*` attributes for JavaScript hooks (clean separation)

**Interactive Features Implementation**:
- Filtering: JavaScript array `.filter()` on attribute findings
- Sorting: JavaScript array `.sort()` with custom comparators
- Collapsible sections: CSS `:target` pseudo-class + JavaScript event listeners
- Progress bars: CSS `width` percentage on div elements
- Color coding: CSS classes based on score thresholds

## 3. Language Detection Strategy

### Decision: File Extension Analysis + gitignore Awareness

**Rationale**:
- File extensions are reliable primary indicator (.py, .js, .ts, .go, .java)
- gitignore exclusion prevents counting generated/vendor code
- Fast scanning (no file content parsing required for detection)
- Supports polyglot repositories (multiple languages)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- GitHub Linguist: Heavyweight dependency, overkill for detection
- File content analysis (shebangs, syntax): Slow, unnecessary
- Package manager detection only: Misses standalone scripts

**Best Practices**:
- Scan repository once, cache language map
- Respect .gitignore patterns (use gitpython's `git ls-files`)
- Map extensions to languages: `.py`→Python, `.js/.jsx`→JavaScript, `.ts/.tsx`→TypeScript
- Handle ambiguous extensions (`.h` could be C or C++)
- Set minimum file threshold (e.g., 5+ files to count as "using language")

## 4. Attribute Weighting System

### Decision: Tier-Based Default + YAML Configuration Override

**Rationale**:
- Research report defines 4 tiers (Essential → Advanced)
- Default weights encode tier priorities (Tier 1 highest impact)
- YAML configuration allows organizational customization
- Weights must sum to 1.0 (percentages) for interpretable scores

**Default Weight Distribution**:
```
Tier 1 (Essential) - 5 attributes:    40% total (8% each)
Tier 2 (Critical) - 6 attributes:     30% total (5% each)
Tier 3 (Important) - 7 attributes:    20% total (~2.86% each)
Tier 4 (Advanced) - 7 attributes:     10% total (~1.43% each)
```

**Configuration File Format** (.agentready-config.yaml):
```yaml
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.08
  conventional_commits: 0.05
  type_annotations: 0.08
  # ... all 25 attributes

# Optional: Override tier defaults
tier_multipliers:
  tier_1: 2.0  # Double importance
  tier_2: 1.5
  tier_3: 1.0
  tier_4: 0.5
```

**Best Practices**:
- Validate weights sum to 1.0 ± 0.01 (floating point tolerance)
- Provide clear error messages for invalid configurations
- Document weight rationale in example config file
- Allow partial overrides (missing attributes use defaults)

## 5. Assessment Architecture Pattern

### Decision: Strategy Pattern with Base Assessor Interface

**Rationale**:
- Each attribute is an independent assessment strategy
- Common interface ensures consistency across assessors
- Easy to add new attributes or modify existing ones
- Enables parallel assessment execution (future optimization)
- Supports graceful degradation (skip failed assessors)

**Base Assessor Interface**:
```python
class BaseAssessor(ABC):
    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def attribute_id(self) -> str:
        """Unique attribute identifier (e.g., 'claude_md_file')"""

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def tier(self) -> int:
        """Tier 1-4 from research report"""

    @abstractmethod
    def assess(self, repository: Repository) -> Finding:
        """Execute assessment, return Finding with score, evidence, remediation"""

    def is_applicable(self, repository: Repository) -> bool:
        """Check if attribute applies to this repository (e.g., language-specific)"""
        return True
```

**Best Practices**:
- Keep assessors stateless (no instance variables)
- Return structured Finding objects (never raw dicts)
- Include specific evidence (file paths, line numbers, measurements)
- Generate remediation guidance from research report content
- Handle errors gracefully (return Finding with error status, not exceptions)
- Use type hints for all method signatures

## 6. Repository Analysis Tools

### Decision: gitpython + Language-Specific Analyzers

**Primary Tools**:
- **gitpython**: Repository metadata, commit history, .gitignore parsing
- **radon**: Python cyclomatic complexity, maintainability index
- **lizard**: Multi-language complexity analysis (C, C++, Java, JavaScript, etc.)
- **stdlib pathlib**: File system traversal and pattern matching

**Rationale**:
- gitpython provides Git-native operations (respects .gitignore)
- radon is Python-specific, highly accurate for Python codebases
- lizard supports multiple languages with consistent interface
- Avoid shell calls to external tools (portability, security)

**Best Practices**:
- Cache file system scans (don't traverse repository multiple times)
- Use gitpython's `git.Repo.iter_commits()` for commit analysis
- Lazy-load analysis tools (import only when language detected)
- Set reasonable limits (max files to analyze, timeout per check)
- Provide progress callbacks for long-running analyses

## 7. Error Handling and Graceful Degradation

### Decision: Try-Assess-Skip Pattern

**Rationale**:
- Partial results more valuable than complete failure
- Users can fix blockers (install missing tools) and re-run
- Clear error reporting enables self-service troubleshooting
- Maintains progress indication (X/25 attributes assessed)

**Error Handling Strategy**:
```python
for assessor in assessors:
    try:
        if not assessor.is_applicable(repo):
            findings.append(Finding.not_applicable(assessor.attribute_id))
            continue

        finding = assessor.assess(repo)
        findings.append(finding)

    except MissingToolError as e:
        findings.append(Finding.skipped(
            assessor.attribute_id,
            reason=f"Missing tool: {e.tool_name}",
            remediation=f"Install with: {e.install_command}"
        ))

    except PermissionError as e:
        findings.append(Finding.skipped(
            assessor.attribute_id,
            reason=f"Permission denied: {e.filename}"
        ))

    except Exception as e:
        findings.append(Finding.error(
            assessor.attribute_id,
            reason=f"Unexpected error: {str(e)}"
        ))
        logger.exception(f"Assessment failed for {assessor.attribute_id}")
```

**Best Practices**:
- Define custom exception types for known failure modes
- Include remediation guidance in error findings
- Log full stack traces for unexpected errors (debugging)
- Count skipped/error attributes separately from assessed
- Adjust score calculation (exclude skipped from denominator per FR-027)

## 8. Report File Naming and Versioning

### Decision: Timestamp-Based Filenames with Latest Symlink

**Rationale**:
- Timestamps enable tracking score improvements over time
- Unique filenames prevent accidental overwrites
- Symlink to latest makes it easy to find most recent report
- ISO 8601 format ensures sortable filenames

**File Naming Convention**:
```
.agentready/
├── report-2025-11-20T14-30-00.html
├── report-2025-11-20T14-30-00.md
├── report-latest.html -> report-2025-11-20T14-30-00.html
└── report-latest.md -> report-2025-11-20T14-30-00.md
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use ISO 8601 with colons replaced by hyphens (cross-platform safe)
- Create symlinks atomically (write to temp, rename)
- Offer `--output-name` flag for custom naming
- Clean up old reports (keep last N runs, configurable)
- Store assessment metadata in JSON sidecar file (for automation)

## 9. Markdown Report Structure

### Decision: GitHub-Flavored Markdown with Tables

**Rationale**:
- GFM is ubiquitous (GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket, VS Code)
- Tables display structured data clearly
- Collapsible sections with `<details>` work in GFM
- Easy to diff in version control

**Report Structure**:
```markdown
# AgentReady Assessment Report

**Repository**: owner/repo
**Date**: 2025-11-20 14:30:00
**Score**: 72/100 (Silver)
**Attributes Assessed**: 23/25 (2 skipped)

## Summary

| Category | Score | Status |
|----------|-------|--------|
| Documentation | 85% | ✅ Pass |
| Code Quality | 62% | ⚠️ Needs Improvement |
| ... | ... | ... |

## Detailed Findings

### 1. Context Window Optimization

#### 1.1 CLAUDE.md Configuration Files ✅

**Score**: 100/100
**Evidence**:
- File exists: `CLAUDE.md` (487 lines)
- Contains tech stack section
- Contains standard commands

<details>
<summary>Good Practices Found</summary>

- Concise format (<1000 lines)
- Clear repository structure
</details>

#### 1.2 Concise Structured Documentation ⚠️

**Score**: 60/100
**Evidence**:
- README exists (1247 lines) - exceeds recommended 500 lines

**Remediation**:
- Split README into multiple docs
- Move detailed API docs to wiki
```

**Best Practices**:
- Use emoji sparingly (✅❌⚠️ for status only)
- Include clickable table of contents for long reports
- Preserve all research report citations
- Use code blocks with language tags for remediation commands
- Keep tables simple (3-5 columns maximum)

## 10. Testing Strategy

### Decision: Pytest with Fixtures + Test Repositories

**Rationale**:
- Pytest is Python's de-facto testing framework
- Fixtures enable reusable test repositories
- Test repositories provide known-good/known-bad data
- Contract tests validate report schemas

**Test Repository Approach**:
Create fixture repositories in `tests/fixtures/repositories/`:
- `minimal-python/`: Bare Python project (most attributes fail)
- `gold-standard-python/`: Exemplary Python project (high score)
- `polyglot/`: Multi-language repository
- `edge-cases/`: Unusual structures (monorepo, submodules, etc.)

**Best Practices**:
- Use `@pytest.fixture(scope="session")` for repository setup (expensive)
- Store expected scores/findings in JSON files
- Test each assessor in isolation (unit tests)
- Test full workflow with real git repositories (integration tests)
- Use `pytest-cov` to enforce >80% coverage
- Mock external tools in unit tests, use real tools in integration tests

## 11. Proportional Scoring Algorithm

### Decision: Linear Proportional Scoring

**Context**: Many attributes have measurable thresholds that can be partially met (e.g., 65% test coverage when 80% is required). Linear proportional scoring provides deterministic, understandable results (per FR-014).

**Rationale**: Linear proportional scoring is:
- **Simple**: Easy to understand and explain to users
- **Deterministic**: Same inputs always produce same outputs
- **Fair**: Provides clear incentives for incremental improvement
- **Predictable**: Users can calculate expected score changes

**Algorithm**:
```python
def calculate_proportional_score(measured_value, threshold, attribute_type):
    """
    Calculate proportional score for partial compliance.

    Args:
        measured_value: The measured value (numeric or parseable)
        threshold: The target threshold
        attribute_type: 'higher_is_better' or 'lower_is_better'

    Returns:
        Score from 0-100
    """
    if attribute_type == 'higher_is_better':
        # Example: test coverage (want higher values)
        if measured_value >= threshold:
            return 100
        elif measured_value <= 0:
            return 0
        else:
            return (measured_value / threshold) * 100

    elif attribute_type == 'lower_is_better':
        # Example: file length (want lower values)
        if measured_value <= threshold:
            return 100
        elif threshold == 0:
            return 0  # Avoid division by zero
        else:
            # Degrade linearly, cap at 0
            return max(0, 100 - ((measured_value - threshold) / threshold) * 100)
```

**Edge Cases**:
- Division by zero: Return 0 score
- Negative values: Clamp to 0
- Values exceeding 2x threshold (lower_is_better): Cap at 0
- Values exceeding 2x threshold (higher_is_better): Cap at 100

**Examples**:
- Test coverage: 65% measured, 80% threshold → 65/80 * 100 = 81.25 score
- File length: 450 lines measured, 300 threshold → 100 - ((450-300)/300)*100 = 50 score
- Cyclomatic complexity: 5 measured, 10 threshold → 100 (meets threshold)

**Alternatives Considered**:
- Exponential penalties: Too harsh for minor violations
- Sigmoid curves: Complex to explain, non-obvious behavior
- Step functions: Too coarse-grained (all-or-nothing)

**References**:
- Spec FR-014: "Tool MUST handle repositories that partially meet attribute criteria"
- Spec FR-027: "Tool MUST calculate overall score based only on successfully evaluated attributes"

## Summary

All technical decisions grounded in pragmatic Python ecosystem best practices. No research gaps or unresolved questions. Implementation can proceed directly to Phase 1 (data modeling and contracts).

# Feature Specification: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Feature Branch**: `001-agentready-scorer`
**Created**: 2025-11-20
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "I want to build a tool that scores git repos based on the findings of this report: agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md. The goal is to prepare a git repo for introduction of agentic development patterns. The tools goal is to provide repo owners with a report and brief remediation plan for each item that requires remediation. the tool must be called agentready. use the content of the report to generate remediation plans etc. i want the report to be a single html file that is interactive. i also want a markdown version of the report to be generated. always generate both formats when the tool is run"

## Clarifications

### Session 2025-11-20

- Q: Where should the agentready tool save the generated HTML and Markdown reports? → A: `.agentready/` directory in repository root by default, with user-specified output directory via CLI flag as option
- Q: How does the agentready tool locate the agent-ready-codebase-attributes.md research report file? → A: Research report bundled with tool installation, with support for downloading latest version from URL/repository
- Q: What should happen if the tool cannot complete assessment for some attributes (e.g., missing analysis tools, permission errors)? → A: Complete available attributes, clearly flag failed/skipped attributes in report with reasons
- Q: What should the tool display to stdout/stderr during execution (before reports are generated)? → A: Summary progress by default, detailed real-time logging with verbose flag
- Q: How should attribute weights be determined for calculating the overall agent-readiness score? → A: Fixed weights based on research report tier system by default, with user-configurable weights via configuration file

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Score Repository Against Agent-Ready Criteria (Priority: P1)

A repository owner wants to assess how well their codebase is optimized for AI-assisted development. They run the agentready tool on their repository and receive a comprehensive score with specific findings across all 25 agent-ready attributes documented in the research report.

**Why this priority**: This is the core value proposition - without scoring and assessment, there is no actionable feedback. This alone provides immediate value by identifying gaps.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the tool against any git repository and verifying it produces a score and identifies attribute compliance levels. Delivers a complete assessment without needing remediation features.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a git repository with various quality attributes, **When** user runs agentready tool on repository, **Then** tool analyzes all 25 attributes from the research report and produces an overall agent-readiness score
2. **Given** a repository missing CLAUDE.md file, **When** agentready scans the repository, **Then** tool correctly identifies this attribute as non-compliant and includes it in the assessment
3. **Given** a repository with 85% test coverage, **When** agentready evaluates test coverage attribute, **Then** tool correctly identifies this as meeting the >80% threshold and scores it positively
4. **Given** a repository with no lock files, **When** agentready checks dependency management, **Then** tool flags missing lock files and includes specific examples of what's missing
5. **Given** analysis is complete, **When** tool generates reports, **Then** both HTML and Markdown versions are created with identical content

---

### User Story 2 - View Interactive HTML Report (Priority: P2)

After running the assessment, the repository owner views an interactive HTML report that allows them to explore findings by category, filter by compliance level, and drill into specific attribute details with expandable sections.

**Why this priority**: Enhances usability and makes large amounts of assessment data digestible. Builds on P1 by improving how results are consumed.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating and opening the HTML report in a browser, verifying interactive elements (collapsible sections, filters, sorting) work without requiring the scoring engine.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agentready has completed assessment, **When** user opens the HTML report in browser, **Then** report displays overall score prominently with visual indicators (color coding, progress bars)
2. **Given** HTML report is displayed, **When** user clicks on an attribute category (e.g., "Documentation Standards"), **Then** section expands to show detailed findings for all attributes in that category
3. **Given** report shows multiple failing attributes, **When** user applies "show only failures" filter, **Then** report hides passing attributes and displays only those requiring remediation
4. **Given** an attribute is marked as failing, **When** user views that attribute in report, **Then** specific evidence is shown (e.g., "File size: src/large_module.py is 847 lines, exceeds 300 line limit")

---

### User Story 3 - Receive Remediation Guidance (Priority: P3)

For each attribute that fails compliance checks, the repository owner receives specific, actionable remediation steps based on the research report's recommendations, tooling suggestions, and examples.

**Why this priority**: Transforms assessment into action. Builds on P1 (scoring) and P2 (viewing) by providing the "what to do next" guidance.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by reviewing remediation plans for known failing attributes and verifying they include specific tools, commands, examples, and links to documentation.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** repository lacks CLAUDE.md file, **When** user views remediation for this attribute, **Then** guidance includes specific template, required sections, and example content
2. **Given** repository has cyclomatic complexity >25 in multiple functions, **When** user views remediation plan, **Then** plan lists specific files/functions exceeding threshold, suggests refactoring tools (radon for Python), and provides complexity reduction strategies
3. **Given** repository missing pre-commit hooks, **When** user views remediation, **Then** plan includes installation commands, sample configuration for the detected language, and links to pre-commit framework documentation
4. **Given** multiple attributes fail, **When** user views overall remediation plan, **Then** plan prioritizes fixes by impact tier (Tier 1 Essential → Tier 4 Advanced) as defined in research report

---

### User Story 4 - Read Markdown Report for Version Control (Priority: P4)

Repository owners want to track agent-readiness improvements over time by committing Markdown reports to version control, allowing them to compare scores across commits and share findings with team members in pull requests.

**Why this priority**: Enables continuous improvement tracking and team collaboration. Enhances existing features but not critical for initial value delivery.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by generating Markdown report, committing it to git, and verifying it renders properly on platforms like GitHub with all tables, formatting, and links intact.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** agentready completes assessment, **When** Markdown report is generated, **Then** report uses standard Markdown formatting (tables, headers, links) that renders correctly on GitHub
2. **Given** Markdown report from previous run exists, **When** user compares it with new report, **Then** differences in scores and attribute compliance are easily identifiable
3. **Given** report contains external citations, **When** user views Markdown report, **Then** all citations from research report are properly linked and attributions preserved

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens when repository is not a git repository (no .git directory)? Tool aborts with clear error message before assessment begins (validated per FR-017)
- How does tool handle extremely large repositories (>100k files)? Tool completes assessment but may exceed 5-minute target (SC-001 applies to <10k files only)
- What if repository uses multiple programming languages with different standards? Tool evaluates all detected languages and applies language-specific criteria per FR-013
- How does tool behave when file access is denied (permission errors)? Tool skips inaccessible files, continues assessment, flags permission issues in report per FR-026
- What if repository has no code files (documentation-only repos)? Tool completes assessment with many attributes marked N/A or failing, still produces valid report
- How does tool handle repositories with submodules or monorepo structures? Tool evaluates repository as-is, treating submodules as part of file structure
- What if HTML/Markdown report generation fails mid-process? Both reports fail atomically per FR-019, no partial report files left
- How does tool handle repositories with non-standard layouts that don't match any common pattern? Tool attempts best-effort pattern matching, may score lower on structure-related attributes

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

---

## 1. CONTEXT WINDOW OPTIMIZATION

### 1.1 CLAUDE.md Configuration Files

**Definition:** Markdown file at repository root automatically ingested by Claude at conversation start.

**Why It Matters:** CLAUDE.md files are "naively dropped into context up front," providing immediate project context without repeated explanations. Reduces prompt engineering time by ~40%.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Immediate understanding of tech stack, repository structure, standard commands
- Consistent adherence to project conventions
- Reduced need for repeated context-setting
- Frames entire session with project-specific guidance

**Measurable Criteria:**
- File size: <1000 lines (concise, focused)
- Essential sections:
  - Tech stack with versions
  - Repository map/structure
  - Standard commands (build, test, lint, format)
  - Testing strategy
  - Style/lint rules
  - Branch/PR workflow
  - "Do not touch" zones
  - Security/compliance notes

**Citation:** Anthropic Engineering Blog - "Claude Code Best Practices" (2025)

**Example:**
```markdown
# Good CLAUDE.md
# Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, pytest, black + isort

# Standard Commands
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Format: `black . && isort .`
- Build: `make build`

# Repository Structure
- src/ - Main application code
- tests/ - Test files mirror src/
- docs/ - Documentation

# Boundaries
- Never modify files in legacy/
- Require approval before changing config.yaml
```

---

### 1.2 Concise, Structured Documentation

**Definition:** Documentation maximizing information density while minimizing token consumption.

**Why It Matters:** Despite expanding context windows (1M+ tokens), attention mechanisms have quadratic complexity growth. Performance drops significantly on long-context tasks: 29%→3% (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) or 70.2%→40% (Qwen2.5).

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster information retrieval through clear headings
- Reduced context pollution
- Improved response accuracy
- Better navigation across documentation

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Use standard Markdown headings (#, ##, ###)
- README <500 lines; use wiki/docs for extensive content
- Table of contents for documents >100 lines
- Bullet points over prose paragraphs
- One concept per section

**Citations:**
- ArXiv: "LongCodeBench: Evaluating Coding LLMs at 1M Context Windows" (2025)
- IBM Research: "Why larger LLM context windows are all the rage"

---

### 1.3 File Size Limits

**Definition:** Individual source files <200-300 lines.

**Why It Matters:** Working memory handles ~4 objects simultaneously. Large files exceed cognitive capacity for both humans and AI.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- More precise file selection
- Reduced irrelevant context in responses
- Safer targeted modifications
- Better understanding of module boundaries

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: <200-300 lines per file
- Warning threshold: 500 lines
- Exception: Generated code, data files
- Enforce via linters (e.g., pylint max-module-lines)

**Citations:**

- Medium: "Psychology of Code Readability" by Egon Elbre

---

## 2. DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### 2.1 README Structure

**Definition:** Standardized README with essential sections in predictable order.

**Why It Matters:** Repositories with well-structured READMEs receive more engagement (GitHub data). README serves as agent's entry point for understanding project purpose, setup, and usage.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster project comprehension
- Accurate answers to onboarding questions
- Better architectural understanding without exploring entire codebase
- Consistent expectations across projects

**Measurable Criteria:**
Essential sections (in order):
1. Project title and description
2. Installation/setup instructions
3. Quick start/usage examples
4. Core features
5. Dependencies and requirements
6. Testing instructions
7. Contributing guidelines
8. License

**Citations:**
- GitHub Blog: "How to write a great agents.md"
- Make a README project documentation
- Welcome to the Jungle: "Essential Sections for Better Documentation"

---

### 2.2 Inline Documentation (Docstrings/Comments)

**Definition:** Function, class, and module-level documentation using language-specific conventions (Python docstrings, JSDoc/TSDoc).

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM experience. Well-typed code directs LLMs into latent space regions corresponding to higher code quality—similar to how LaTeX-formatted math problems get better results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding function purpose without reading implementation
- Better parameter validation suggestions
- More accurate return type predictions
- Improved test generation
- Enhanced refactoring confidence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- All public functions/methods have docstrings
- Docstrings include: description, parameters, return values, exceptions, examples
- Python: PEP 257 compliant
- JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc or TSDoc
- Coverage: >80% of public API documented
- Tools: pydocstyle, documentation-js

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output, and AsyncIO"
- ArXiv: "TypyBench: Evaluating LLM Type Inference for Untyped Python Repositories"
- TypeScript Documentation: JSDoc Reference

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Comprehensive docstring
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate discounted price.

    Args:
        price: Original price in USD
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)

    Returns:
        Discounted price

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent not in 0-100 range

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100.0, 20.0)
        80.0
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount must be 0-100")
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

# Bad: No documentation
def calc_disc(p, d):
    return p * (1 - d / 100)
```

---

### 2.3 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Definition:** Lightweight documents capturing architectural decisions with context, decision, and consequences.

**Why It Matters:** ADRs provide historical context for "why" decisions were made. When AI encounters patterns or constraints, ADRs explain rationale, preventing counter-productive suggestions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding project evolution and design philosophy
- Avoiding proposing previously rejected alternatives
- Aligning suggestions with established architectural principles
- Better context for refactoring recommendations

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Store in `docs/adr/` or `.adr/` directory
- Use consistent template (Michael Nygard or MADR)
- Each ADR includes: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Status values: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- One decision per ADR
- Sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002...)

**Citations:**
- AWS Prescriptive Guidance: "ADR process"
- GitHub: joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record
- Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework

**Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

Status: Accepted

## Context
Need persistent storage supporting ACID transactions, complex queries, and JSON data.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL 14+ as primary database.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Rich query capabilities (joins, window functions)
- JSON support via jsonb

Negative:
- More operational complexity than managed NoSQL
- Requires schema migration planning
- Horizontal scaling more complex
```

---

## 3. CODE QUALITY METRICS

### 3.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds

**Definition:** Measurement of linearly independent paths through code, indicating decision point density.

**Why It Matters:** High cyclomatic complexity confuses both humans and AI. While not perfect (doesn't capture cognitive complexity), it correlates strongly with testing difficulty and error potential.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Functions with complexity >25 are harder to understand
- Reduced confidence in safe modifications
- More difficult to generate comprehensive tests
- Increased likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- Warning threshold: 15
- Error threshold: 25
- Tools: clang-tidy (C++), radon (Python), complexity-report (JavaScript), gocyclo (Go)

**Citations:**
- Microsoft Learn: "Code metrics - Cyclomatic complexity"
- Checkstyle Documentation
- LinearB Blog: "Cyclomatic Complexity explained"

---

### 3.2 Function/Method Length Limits

**Definition:** Keeping functions/methods small (typically <50 lines, ideally <20).

**Why It Matters:** Working memory handles ~4 objects simultaneously. Long functions exceed cognitive capacity. Research on reading comprehension shows lines >50-75 characters reduce comprehension; code has higher cognitive load per line.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Easier holistic function understanding
- Better isolation for testing
- Safer modifications without unintended side effects
- Clearer single responsibility principle adherence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: <20 lines per function
- Warning: 50 lines
- Hard limit: 100 lines
- Exception: Complex algorithms with extensive explanatory comments
- Tools: pylint (max-function-lines), eslint (max-lines-per-function)

**Citations:**
- Medium: "Psychology of Code Readability" by Egon Elbre
- UX Stack Exchange: Line length readability research
- Clang-Tidy: readability-function-cognitive-complexity

---

### 3.3 Type Annotations (Static Typing)

**Definition:** Explicit type declarations for variables, parameters, and return values.

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM code understanding. Higher-quality codebases have type annotations, directing LLMs toward higher-quality latent space regions. Creates synergistic improvement: LLMs generate better typed code, which helps future LLM interactions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better input validation
- Type error detection before execution
- Structured output generation
- Improved autocomplete suggestions
- Enhanced refactoring safety

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Python: All public functions have parameter and return type hints
- TypeScript: `strict` mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Go: Inherently typed
- Coverage: >80% of functions typed
- Tools: mypy (Python), pyright (Python), tsc --strict (TypeScript)

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output"
- ArXiv: "Automated Type Annotation in Python Using LLMs"
- Dropbox Tech Blog: "Our journey to type checking 4 million lines of Python"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Full type annotations
from typing import List, Optional

def find_users(
    role: str,
    active: bool = True,
    limit: Optional[int] = None
) -> List[User]:
    """Find users matching criteria."""
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()

# Bad: No type hints
def find_users(role, active=True, limit=None):
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()
```

---

### 3.4 Code Smell Elimination

**Definition:** Removing indicators of deeper problems: long methods, large classes, duplicate code, dead code, magic numbers.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows AI-generated code increases "code churn" (copy/paste vs. refactoring) and DRY principle violations. Clean baseline prevents AI from perpetuating anti-patterns.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better intent understanding
- More accurate refactoring suggestions
- Avoidance of anti-pattern propagation
- Improved code quality over time

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Tools: SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle, pylint, eslint
- Zero critical smells
- <5 major smells per 1000 lines of code
- Common smells monitored:
  - Duplicate code (DRY violations)
  - Long methods (>50 lines)
  - Large classes (>500 lines)
  - Long parameter lists (>5 params)
  - Divergent change (one class changing for multiple reasons)

**Citations:**
- GitClear: "Coding on Copilot" whitepaper
- Codacy Blog: "Code Smells and Anti-Patterns"
- ScienceDirect: "Code smells and refactoring: A tertiary systematic review"

---

## 4. REPOSITORY STRUCTURE

### 4.1 Standard Project Layouts

**Definition:** Using community-recognized directory structures for each language/framework.

**Why It Matters:** Standard layouts reduce cognitive overhead. AI models trained on open-source code recognize patterns (Python's src/, Go's cmd/ and internal/, Java's Maven structure).

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster navigation
- Accurate location assumptions for new files
- Automatic adherence to established conventions
- Reduced confusion about file placement

**Measurable Criteria:**

**Python (src layout):**
```
project/
├── src/
│   └── package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module.py
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

**Go:**
```
project/
├── cmd/           # Main applications
│   └── app/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/      # Private code
├── pkg/           # Public libraries
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js):**
```
project/
├── src/
├── test/
├── dist/
├── package.json
├── package-lock.json
└── tsconfig.json
```

**Citations:**
- Real Python: "Python Application Layouts"
- GitHub: golang-standards/project-layout
- Stack Overflow: "Best project structure for Python application"

---

### 4.2 Separation of Concerns

**Definition:** Organizing code so each module/file/function has single, well-defined responsibility (SOLID principles).

**Why It Matters:** 2 of 5 SOLID principles derive directly from separation of concerns. Clear boundaries improve testability, maintainability, and reduce cognitive load.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Targeted modifications without affecting unrelated code
- Better refactoring suggestions
- Clearer module purpose understanding
- Reduced side effect risk

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Each module/class has one reason to change
- High cohesion within modules (related functions together)
- Low coupling between modules (minimal dependencies)
- Organize by feature/domain, not technical layer (avoid separate "controllers", "services", "models" directories)

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Separation of concerns"
- DevIQ: "Separation of Concerns"
- Medium: "Single responsibility and Separation of concerns principles"

---

## 5. TESTING & CI/CD

### 5.1 Test Coverage Requirements

**Definition:** Percentage of code executed by automated tests.

**Why It Matters:** High test coverage enables confident AI modifications. Research shows AI tools (Cursor AI) can cut test coverage time by 85% while maintaining quality—but only when good tests exist as foundation.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Safety net enabling aggressive refactoring
- Tests document expected behavior
- Immediate feedback on breaking changes
- Higher confidence in suggested modifications

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Minimum: 70% line coverage
- Target: 80-90% line coverage
- Critical paths: 100% coverage
- Track: Statement coverage, branch coverage, function coverage
- Tools: pytest-cov (Python), Jest/Istanbul (JavaScript), go test -cover (Go)
- Coverage reports in CI/CD with failure threshold

**Citations:**
- Salesforce Engineering: "How Cursor AI Cut Legacy Code Coverage Time by 85%"
- Qodo AI Blog: "Harnessing AI to Revolutionize Test Coverage Analysis"
- Medium: "How to Improve Code Coverage using Generative AI tools"

---

### 5.2 Test Naming Conventions

**Definition:** Descriptive test names following patterns like `test_should_<expected>_when_<condition>`.

**Why It Matters:** Clear test names help AI understand intent without reading implementation. When tests fail, AI diagnoses issues faster with self-documenting names.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Generation of similar test patterns
- Faster edge case understanding
- More accurate fix proposals aligned with intent
- Better test coverage gap identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pattern: `test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`
- Example: `test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error`
- Avoid: `test1`, `test_edge_case`, `test_bug_fix`, `test_method_name`
- Test names should be readable as sentences

**Citations:**
- pytest documentation: Test naming best practices
- JUnit best practices
- Go testing conventions

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Self-documenting test names
def test_create_user_with_valid_data_returns_user_instance():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert isinstance(user, User)

def test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid email"):
        create_user(email="not-an-email", name="Test")

def test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_integrity_error():
    create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 1")
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 2")

# Bad: Unclear test names
def test_user1():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert user

### 5.3 Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD Linting

**Definition:** Automated code quality checks before commits (pre-commit hooks) and in CI/CD pipeline.

**Why It Matters:** Pre-commit hooks provide immediate feedback but can be bypassed. Running same checks in CI/CD ensures enforcement. Linting errors prevent successful CI runs, wasting time and compute.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Ensures AI-generated code meets quality standards
- Immediate feedback loop for improvements
- Consistent code style across all contributions
- Prevents low-quality code from entering repository

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pre-commit framework installed and configured

    f"Fix: Ensure discount_percent is a number in range [0, 100]."
)

# Bad: Vague error
raise ValueError("Invalid input")

# Good: API error with context
{
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_DISCOUNT",
        "message": "Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100",
        "details": {
            "field": "discount_percent",
            "value": 150,
            "constraint": "0 <= value <= 100"
        },
        "request_id": "req_abc123"
    }
}
```

---

### 9.2 Structured Logging

import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info(
    "user_login_success",
    user_id="user_123",
    request_id="req_abc",
    duration_ms=45,
    ip_address="192.168.1.1"
)

# Output:
# {"timestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z", "level": "info", "event": "user_login_success",
#  "user_id": "user_123", "request_id": "req_abc", "duration_ms": 45, "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"}

# Bad: Unstructured logging

  - **Python:** PEP 8 (snake_case functions, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants)
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** camelCase functions/variables, PascalCase classes
  - **Go:** mixedCaps (exported: UpperCase, unexported: lowerCase)
  - **Java:** camelCase methods, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants
- Use paired opposites consistently: add/remove, start/stop, begin/end, open/close
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood (HTTP, API, URL, ID)
- Enforce via linters: pylint, eslint, golint

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Naming convention (programming)"
- Microsoft Learn: "General Naming Conventions"
- PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
- Google Style Guides (Java, Python, JavaScript, Go)

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Consistent naming
class UserService:
    MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5

    def create_user(self, email: str) -> User:
        """Create new user."""
        pass

    def delete_user(self, user_id: str) -> None:
        """Delete existing user."""
        pass

# Bad: Inconsistent naming
class userservice:
    maxLoginAttempts = 5

    def CreateUser(self, e: str) -> User:
        pass

    def removeUser(self, uid: str) -> None:
        pass
```

## 14. DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

### 14.1 "Why, Not What" Comments

**Definition:** Comments explain rationale and context, not behavior (which code already shows).

**Why It Matters:** AI can read code to understand "what" it does. Comments providing "why" give context for decisions, workarounds, constraints, and edge cases that aren't obvious from code alone.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding of constraints and limitations
- Avoidance of "obvious" refactorings that break assumptions
- Preservation of original intent during modifications
- Better context for debugging and optimization

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Comments explain:**
  - Why this approach was chosen (vs. alternatives)
  - Edge cases and gotchas
  - Performance considerations
  - Historical context (why workaround exists)
  - TODOs with context and rationale
- **Avoid:**
  - Redundant comments duplicating code
  - Commented-out code (use version control)
  - Obvious statements
- **Keep comments in sync** with code during changes

**Citations:**
- Stack Overflow Blog: "Best practices for writing code comments"
- Stepsize: "The Engineer's Guide to Writing Meaningful Code Comments"
- Boot.dev: "Best Practices for Commenting Code"

**Example:**
```python

## 15. PERFORMANCE & OBSERVABILITY

### 15.1 Performance Benchmarks

**Definition:** Automated performance tests tracking metrics like response time, throughput, memory usage.

**Why It Matters:** Performance regressions can slip in unnoticed. Benchmarks provide objective measurements. AI can suggest optimizations based on benchmark results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Performance-aware optimization suggestions
- Regression detection
- Data-driven refactoring decisions
- Bottleneck identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Benchmark suite in repository
- **Tools:** pytest-benchmark (Python), Benchmark.js (JavaScript), testing.B (Go)
- Run benchmarks in CI for critical paths
- Track metrics over time
- Alert on regressions (>10% slowdown)

**Citations:**
- Google: "Benchmarking Best Practices"
- Python performance benchmarking docs
- Go benchmarking documentation

9. Structured logging
10. API specifications (OpenAPI/GraphQL)

---

## 1. CONTEXT WINDOW OPTIMIZATION

### 1.1 CLAUDE.md Configuration Files

**Definition:** Markdown file at repository root automatically ingested by Claude at conversation start.

**Why It Matters:** CLAUDE.md files are "naively dropped into context up front," providing immediate project context without repeated explanations. Reduces prompt engineering time by ~40%.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Immediate understanding of tech stack, repository structure, standard commands
- Consistent adherence to project conventions
- Reduced need for repeated context-setting
- Frames entire session with project-specific guidance

**Measurable Criteria:**
- File size: <1000 lines (concise, focused)
- Essential sections:
  - Tech stack with versions
  - Repository map/structure
  - Standard commands (build, test, lint, format)
  - Testing strategy
  - Style/lint rules
  - Branch/PR workflow
  - "Do not touch" zones
  - Security/compliance notes

**Citation:** Anthropic Engineering Blog - "Claude Code Best Practices" (2025)

**Example:**
```markdown
# Good CLAUDE.md
# Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+, pytest, black + isort

# Standard Commands
- Run tests: `pytest tests/`
- Format: `black . && isort .`
- Build: `make build`

# Repository Structure
- src/ - Main application code
- tests/ - Test files mirror src/
- docs/ - Documentation

# Boundaries
- Never modify files in legacy/
- Require approval before changing config.yaml
```

---

### 1.2 Concise, Structured Documentation

**Definition:** Documentation maximizing information density while minimizing token consumption.

**Why It Matters:** Despite expanding context windows (1M+ tokens), attention mechanisms have quadratic complexity growth. Performance drops significantly on long-context tasks: 29%→3% (Claude 3.5 Sonnet) or 70.2%→40% (Qwen2.5).

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster information retrieval through clear headings
- Reduced context pollution
- Improved response accuracy
- Better navigation across documentation

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Use standard Markdown headings (#, ##, ###)
- README <500 lines; use wiki/docs for extensive content
- Table of contents for documents >100 lines
- Bullet points over prose paragraphs
- One concept per section

**Citations:**
- ArXiv: "LongCodeBench: Evaluating Coding LLMs at 1M Context Windows" (2025)
- IBM Research: "Why larger LLM context windows are all the rage"

---

### 1.3 File Size Limits

**Definition:** Individual source files <200-300 lines.

**Why It Matters:** Working memory handles ~4 objects simultaneously. Large files exceed cognitive capacity for both humans and AI.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- More precise file selection
- Reduced irrelevant context in responses
- Safer targeted modifications
- Better understanding of module boundaries

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: <200-300 lines per file
- Warning threshold: 500 lines
- Exception: Generated code, data files
- Enforce via linters (e.g., pylint max-module-lines)

**Citations:**
- Stack Overflow: "At what point/range is a code file too big?"
- Medium: "Psychology of Code Readability" by Egon Elbre

---

## 2. DOCUMENTATION STANDARDS

### 2.1 README Structure

**Definition:** Standardized README with essential sections in predictable order.

**Why It Matters:** Repositories with well-structured READMEs receive more engagement (GitHub data). README serves as agent's entry point for understanding project purpose, setup, and usage.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster project comprehension
- Accurate answers to onboarding questions
- Better architectural understanding without exploring entire codebase
- Consistent expectations across projects

**Measurable Criteria:**
Essential sections (in order):
1. Project title and description
2. Installation/setup instructions
3. Quick start/usage examples
4. Core features
5. Dependencies and requirements
6. Testing instructions
7. Contributing guidelines
8. License

**Citations:**
- GitHub Blog: "How to write a great agents.md"
- Make a README project documentation
- Welcome to the Jungle: "Essential Sections for Better Documentation"

---

### 2.2 Inline Documentation (Docstrings/Comments)

**Definition:** Function, class, and module-level documentation using language-specific conventions (Python docstrings, JSDoc/TSDoc).

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM experience. Well-typed code directs LLMs into latent space regions corresponding to higher code quality—similar to how LaTeX-formatted math problems get better results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding function purpose without reading implementation
- Better parameter validation suggestions
- More accurate return type predictions
- Improved test generation
- Enhanced refactoring confidence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- All public functions/methods have docstrings
- Docstrings include: description, parameters, return values, exceptions, examples
- Python: PEP 257 compliant
- JavaScript/TypeScript: JSDoc or TSDoc
- Coverage: >80% of public API documented
- Tools: pydocstyle, documentation-js

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output, and AsyncIO"
- ArXiv: "TypyBench: Evaluating LLM Type Inference for Untyped Python Repositories"
- TypeScript Documentation: JSDoc Reference

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Comprehensive docstring
def calculate_discount(price: float, discount_percent: float) -> float:
    """
    Calculate discounted price.

    Args:
        price: Original price in USD
        discount_percent: Discount percentage (0-100)

    Returns:
        Discounted price

    Raises:
        ValueError: If discount_percent not in 0-100 range

    Example:
        >>> calculate_discount(100.0, 20.0)
        80.0
    """
    if not 0 <= discount_percent <= 100:
        raise ValueError("Discount must be 0-100")
    return price * (1 - discount_percent / 100)

# Bad: No documentation
def calc_disc(p, d):
    return p * (1 - d / 100)
```

---

### 2.3 Architecture Decision Records (ADRs)

**Definition:** Lightweight documents capturing architectural decisions with context, decision, and consequences.

**Why It Matters:** ADRs provide historical context for "why" decisions were made. When AI encounters patterns or constraints, ADRs explain rationale, preventing counter-productive suggestions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding project evolution and design philosophy
- Avoiding proposing previously rejected alternatives
- Aligning suggestions with established architectural principles
- Better context for refactoring recommendations

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Store in `docs/adr/` or `.adr/` directory
- Use consistent template (Michael Nygard or MADR)
- Each ADR includes: Title, Status, Context, Decision, Consequences
- Status values: Proposed, Accepted, Deprecated, Superseded
- One decision per ADR
- Sequential numbering (ADR-001, ADR-002...)

**Citations:**
- AWS Prescriptive Guidance: "ADR process"
- GitHub: joelparkerhenderson/architecture-decision-record
- Microsoft Azure Well-Architected Framework

**Template:**
```markdown
# ADR-001: Use PostgreSQL for Primary Database

Status: Accepted

## Context
Need persistent storage supporting ACID transactions, complex queries, and JSON data.

## Decision
Use PostgreSQL 14+ as primary database.

## Consequences
Positive:
- Strong ACID guarantees
- Rich query capabilities (joins, window functions)
- JSON support via jsonb

Negative:
- More operational complexity than managed NoSQL
- Requires schema migration planning
- Horizontal scaling more complex
```

---

## 3. CODE QUALITY METRICS

### 3.1 Cyclomatic Complexity Thresholds

**Definition:** Measurement of linearly independent paths through code, indicating decision point density.

**Why It Matters:** High cyclomatic complexity confuses both humans and AI. While not perfect (doesn't capture cognitive complexity), it correlates strongly with testing difficulty and error potential.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Functions with complexity >25 are harder to understand
- Reduced confidence in safe modifications
- More difficult to generate comprehensive tests
- Increased likelihood of introducing bugs during refactoring

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: Cyclomatic complexity <10 per function
- Warning threshold: 15
- Error threshold: 25
- Tools: clang-tidy (C++), radon (Python), complexity-report (JavaScript), gocyclo (Go)

**Citations:**

### 3.2 Function/Method Length Limits

**Definition:** Keeping functions/methods small (typically <50 lines, ideally <20).

**Why It Matters:** Working memory handles ~4 objects simultaneously. Long functions exceed cognitive capacity. Research on reading comprehension shows lines >50-75 characters reduce comprehension; code has higher cognitive load per line.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Easier holistic function understanding
- Better isolation for testing
- Safer modifications without unintended side effects
- Clearer single responsibility principle adherence

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Target: <20 lines per function
- Warning: 50 lines
- Hard limit: 100 lines
- Exception: Complex algorithms with extensive explanatory comments
- Tools: pylint (max-function-lines), eslint (max-lines-per-function)

### 3.3 Type Annotations (Static Typing)

**Definition:** Explicit type declarations for variables, parameters, and return values.

**Why It Matters:** Type hints significantly improve LLM code understanding. Higher-quality codebases have type annotations, directing LLMs toward higher-quality latent space regions. Creates synergistic improvement: LLMs generate better typed code, which helps future LLM interactions.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better input validation
- Type error detection before execution
- Structured output generation
- Improved autocomplete suggestions
- Enhanced refactoring safety

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Python: All public functions have parameter and return type hints
- TypeScript: `strict` mode enabled in tsconfig.json
- Go: Inherently typed
- Coverage: >80% of functions typed
- Tools: mypy (Python), pyright (Python), tsc --strict (TypeScript)

**Citations:**
- Medium: "LLM Coding Concepts: Static Typing, Structured Output"
- ArXiv: "Automated Type Annotation in Python Using LLMs"
- Dropbox Tech Blog: "Our journey to type checking 4 million lines of Python"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Full type annotations
from typing import List, Optional

def find_users(
    role: str,
    active: bool = True,
    limit: Optional[int] = None
) -> List[User]:
    """Find users matching criteria."""
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()

# Bad: No type hints
def find_users(role, active=True, limit=None):
    query = User.query.filter_by(role=role, active=active)
    if limit:
        query = query.limit(limit)
    return query.all()
```

### 3.4 Code Smell Elimination

**Definition:** Removing indicators of deeper problems: long methods, large classes, duplicate code, dead code, magic numbers.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows AI-generated code increases "code churn" (copy/paste vs. refactoring) and DRY principle violations. Clean baseline prevents AI from perpetuating anti-patterns.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Better intent understanding
- More accurate refactoring suggestions
- Avoidance of anti-pattern propagation
- Improved code quality over time

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Tools: SonarQube, PMD, Checkstyle, pylint, eslint
- Zero critical smells
- <5 major smells per 1000 lines of code
- Common smells monitored:
  - Duplicate code (DRY violations)
  - Long methods (>50 lines)
  - Large classes (>500 lines)
  - Long parameter lists (>5 params)
  - Divergent change (one class changing for multiple reasons)

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster navigation
- Accurate location assumptions for new files
- Automatic adherence to established conventions
- Reduced confusion about file placement

**Measurable Criteria:**

**Python (src layout):**
```
project/
├── src/
│   └── package/
│       ├── __init__.py
│       └── module.py
├── tests/
├── docs/
├── README.md
├── pyproject.toml
└── requirements.txt
```

**Go:**
```
project/
├── cmd/           # Main applications
│   └── app/
│       └── main.go
├── internal/      # Private code
├── pkg/           # Public libraries
├── go.mod
└── go.sum
```

**JavaScript/TypeScript (Node.js):**
```
project/

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Targeted modifications without affecting unrelated code
- Better refactoring suggestions
- Clearer module purpose understanding
- Reduced side effect risk

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Each module/class has one reason to change
- High cohesion within modules (related functions together)
- Low coupling between modules (minimal dependencies)
- Organize by feature/domain, not technical layer (avoid separate "controllers", "services", "models" directories)

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Separation of concerns"
- DevIQ: "Separation of Concerns"
- Medium: "Single responsibility and Separation of concerns principles"

---

## 5. TESTING & CI/CD

### 5.1 Test Coverage Requirements

**Definition:** Percentage of code executed by automated tests.

**Why It Matters:** High test coverage enables confident AI modifications. Research shows AI tools (Cursor AI) can cut test coverage time by 85% while maintaining quality—but only when good tests exist as foundation.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**

- Qodo AI Blog: "Harnessing AI to Revolutionize Test Coverage Analysis"
- Medium: "How to Improve Code Coverage using Generative AI tools"

---

### 5.2 Test Naming Conventions

**Definition:** Descriptive test names following patterns like `test_should_<expected>_when_<condition>`.

**Why It Matters:** Clear test names help AI understand intent without reading implementation. When tests fail, AI diagnoses issues faster with self-documenting names.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Generation of similar test patterns
- Faster edge case understanding
- More accurate fix proposals aligned with intent
- Better test coverage gap identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pattern: `test_<method>_<scenario>_<expected_outcome>`
- Example: `test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error`
- Avoid: `test1`, `test_edge_case`, `test_bug_fix`, `test_method_name`
- Test names should be readable as sentences

**Citations:**
- pytest documentation: Test naming best practices
- JUnit best practices
- Go testing conventions

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Self-documenting test names
def test_create_user_with_valid_data_returns_user_instance():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert isinstance(user, User)

def test_create_user_with_invalid_email_raises_value_error():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError, match="Invalid email"):
        create_user(email="not-an-email", name="Test")

def test_create_user_with_duplicate_email_raises_integrity_error():
    create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 1")
    with pytest.raises(IntegrityError):
        create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test 2")

# Bad: Unclear test names
def test_user1():
    user = create_user(email="test@example.com", name="Test")
    assert user

def test_user2():
    with pytest.raises(ValueError):
        create_user(email="invalid", name="Test")
```

---

### 5.3 Pre-commit Hooks & CI/CD Linting

**Definition:** Automated code quality checks before commits (pre-commit hooks) and in CI/CD pipeline.

**Why It Matters:** Pre-commit hooks provide immediate feedback but can be bypassed. Running same checks in CI/CD ensures enforcement. Linting errors prevent successful CI runs, wasting time and compute.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Ensures AI-generated code meets quality standards
- Immediate feedback loop for improvements
- Consistent code style across all contributions
- Prevents low-quality code from entering repository

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Pre-commit framework installed and configured

  - Formatters: black/autopep8 (Python), prettier (JS/TS), gofmt (Go)
  - Linters: flake8/pylint (Python), eslint (JS/TS), golint (Go)
  - Type checkers: mypy/pyright (Python), tsc (TypeScript)
- **Critical:** Same checks run in CI/CD (non-skippable)
- CI fails on any linting error
- Fast execution: <30 seconds total

**Citations:**
- Memfault Blog: "Automatically format and lint code with pre-commit"
- Medium: "Elevate Your CI: Mastering Pre-commit Hooks and GitHub Actions"
- GitHub: pre-commit/pre-commit

    f"Invalid discount percentage: {discount_percent}. "
    f"Expected value between 0 and 100. "
    f"Received: {discount_percent} (type: {type(discount_percent).__name__}). "
    f"Fix: Ensure discount_percent is a number in range [0, 100]."
)

# Bad: Vague error
raise ValueError("Invalid input")

# Good: API error with context
{
    "error": {
        "code": "INVALID_DISCOUNT",
        "message": "Discount percentage must be between 0 and 100",
        "details": {
            "field": "discount_percent",
            "value": 150,
            "constraint": "0 <= value <= 100"
        },
        "request_id": "req_abc123"
    }
}
```

---

### 9.2 Structured Logging

**Definition:** Logging in structured format (JSON) with consistent field names and types.

**Why It Matters:** Structured logs are machine-parseable. AI can analyze logs to diagnose issues, identify patterns, suggest optimizations, and correlate events across distributed systems.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**

# Good: Structured logging
import structlog

logger = structlog.get_logger()

logger.info(
    "user_login_success",
    user_id="user_123",
    request_id="req_abc",
    duration_ms=45,
    ip_address="192.168.1.1"
)

# Output:
# {"timestamp": "2025-01-20T10:30:00Z", "level": "info", "event": "user_login_success",
#  "user_id": "user_123", "request_id": "req_abc", "duration_ms": 45, "ip_address": "192.168.1.1"}

# Bad: Unstructured logging

- Schema validation
- Performance optimization suggestions (N+1 query detection)
- Type-safe client generation
- API evolution guidance

**Measurable Criteria:**
- schema.graphql file in repository
- All types, queries, mutations include descriptions
- Use directives for:
  - Deprecation (@deprecated)
  - Authorization (@auth)
  - Field resolution hints
- Schema validation in CI/CD
- SDL-first approach (schema-first, not code-first)

**Citations:**
- GraphQL documentation: "Schema Definition Language"
- Apollo GraphQL: "Schema design best practices"
- Hasura GraphQL best practices

**Example:**
```graphql
# Good: Well-documented GraphQL schema
"""
Represents a user in the system

  Find a user by their unique ID
  """
  user(id: ID!): User

  """
  List all users with optional filtering
  """
  users(role: String, active: Boolean): [User!]!
}
```

## 11. MODULARITY & CODE ORGANIZATION

### 11.1 DRY Principle (Don't Repeat Yourself)

**Definition:** Every piece of knowledge has single, authoritative representation in the system.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows AI-generated code increases code churn and DRY violations (copy-paste instead of refactoring). Enforcing DRY in codebase teaches AI to refactor rather than duplicate.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Learns to extract shared logic
- Suggests refactorings instead of duplication
- Avoids creating duplicate implementations
- Better abstraction identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- "Three Strikes" rule: Third duplicate occurrence triggers refactoring

### 11.2 Consistent Naming Conventions

**Definition:** Systematic naming patterns for variables, functions, classes, files following language/framework conventions.

**Why It Matters:** Research shows identifier style affects recall and precision. Consistency reduces cognitive load. AI models recognize naming patterns from training on open-source code.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Accurate intent inference
- Appropriate name suggestions
- Code structure understanding
- Pattern recognition

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Follow language conventions:
  - **Python:** PEP 8 (snake_case functions, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants)
  - **JavaScript/TypeScript:** camelCase functions/variables, PascalCase classes
  - **Go:** mixedCaps (exported: UpperCase, unexported: lowerCase)
  - **Java:** camelCase methods, PascalCase classes, UPPER_CASE constants
- Use paired opposites consistently: add/remove, start/stop, begin/end, open/close
- Avoid abbreviations unless widely understood (HTTP, API, URL, ID)
- Enforce via linters: pylint, eslint, golint

**Citations:**
- Wikipedia: "Naming convention (programming)"
- Microsoft Learn: "General Naming Conventions"
- PEP 8 - Style Guide for Python Code
- Google Style Guides (Java, Python, JavaScript, Go)

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Consistent naming
class UserService:
    MAX_LOGIN_ATTEMPTS = 5

    def create_user(self, email: str) -> User:
        """Create new user."""
        pass

    def delete_user(self, user_id: str) -> None:
        """Delete existing user."""
        pass

# Bad: Inconsistent naming
class userservice:
    maxLoginAttempts = 5

    def CreateUser(self, e: str) -> User:
        pass

    def removeUser(self, uid: str) -> None:
        pass
```

---

### 11.3 Semantic File & Directory Naming

**Definition:** File names and directory structures that convey purpose and content clearly.

**Why It Matters:** Semantic organization helps AI locate relevant code quickly. Clear names reduce cognitive overhead and enable predictable file location.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Faster relevant file location
- Accurate placement suggestions for new code
- Better repository organization understanding
- Reduced search time

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Feature-based organization:** Group related files by feature/domain, not technical layer
- **Clear, descriptive names:** `user_service.py` not `us.py`
- **Avoid abbreviations** unless standard in domain
- **Mirror test structure** to source structure:
  - `src/services/user_service.py` → `tests/services/test_user_service.py`
- **Consistent file extensions:** .py, .js, .ts, .go
- **Module files:** `__init__.py`, index.js for package entry points

**Citations:**
- GitHub: kriasoft/Folder-Structure-Conventions
- Iterators: "Comprehensive Guide on Project Codebase Organization"
- Medium: "A Front-End Application Folder Structure that Makes Sense"

**Example:**
```
# Good: Feature-based, semantic organization
src/
├── auth/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── login_service.py
│   ├── oauth_provider.py

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- CI improvement proposals
- Pipeline failure debugging
- Workflow optimization suggestions
- Better understanding of deployment process

**Measurable Criteria:**
- CI config file in repository:
  - GitHub Actions: `.github/workflows/`
  - GitLab CI: `.gitlab-ci.yml`
  - CircleCI: `.circleci/config.yml`
- **Clear job/step names** (not "step1", "step2")
- **Comments explaining complex logic**
- **Fast feedback:** Tests complete <10 minutes
- **Fail fast:** Stop on first failure to save compute
- **Parallelization:** Run independent jobs concurrently
- **Caching:** Dependencies, build artifacts
- **Artifacts:** Test results, coverage reports, logs

**Citations:**
- CircleCI: "Monorepo dev practices"
- GitHub Actions documentation
- GitLab CI best practices
- Martin Fowler: "Continuous Integration"

---

### 12.2 Branch Protection & Status Checks

**Definition:** Required status checks and review approvals before merging to main/production branches.

**Why It Matters:** Prevents broken code from reaching production. Provides safety net for AI-generated code. Ensures quality gates are enforced.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding of merge requirements
- Awareness of quality gates
- Suggestions aligned with branch policies
- Better PR creation (ensuring checks pass)

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Branch protection enabled for main/master/production
- **Required status checks:**
  - All tests passing
  - Linting/formatting passing
  - Code coverage threshold met
  - Security scanning passing
- **Required reviews:** At least 1 approval
- **No force pushes** to protected branches
- **No direct commits** to protected branches
- **Up-to-date branch** requirement (rebase/merge before merging)

**Citations:**
- GitHub Docs: "About protected branches"
- GitLab: "Protected branches"
- Industry best practices

---

## 13. SECURITY & COMPLIANCE

### 13.1 Security Scanning Automation

**Definition:** Automated security scans for vulnerabilities, secrets, and compliance issues in CI/CD.

**Why It Matters:** AI can accidentally introduce vulnerabilities (SQL injection, XSS, etc.). Research shows LLM-generated code has security weaknesses, particularly around outdated practices. Automated scanning provides safety net.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Security pattern learning
- Vulnerability avoidance
- Secure coding practice adoption
- Failed scans provide improvement feedback

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Dependency scanning:** Snyk, Dependabot, npm audit, safety (Python)
- **Secret scanning:** GitLeaks, TruffleHog, detect-secrets
- **Static analysis:** Semgrep, CodeQL, Bandit (Python), gosec (Go)
- **Scans run on:**
  - Every PR (pre-merge)
  - Every commit to main
  - Scheduled (weekly/nightly)
- **Zero tolerance:** No high/critical vulnerabilities allowed to merge
- **SLA:** High severity vulnerabilities fixed within 7 days

**Citations:**
- ArXiv: "Security and Quality in LLM-Generated Code"
- ArXiv: "Security Degradation in Iterative AI Code Generation"
- GitHub Advanced Security documentation
- OWASP Top 10

---

### 13.2 Secrets Management

**Definition:** Proper handling of sensitive data (API keys, passwords, tokens) using secret management tools, not hardcoded values.

**Why It Matters:** Hardcoded secrets in code create security vulnerabilities. AI might accidentally suggest or expose secrets. Proper secrets management is critical security practice.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Avoids suggesting hardcoded secrets
- Recommends environment variables
- Identifies potential secret exposure
- Suggests secure alternatives

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **No secrets in code:** Use environment variables, secret managers
- **Tools:**
  - Development: .env files (not committed), direnv
  - Production: HashiCorp Vault, AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault, GCP Secret Manager
- **.env.example** committed (without real values)
- **.env** in .gitignore
- **Secret rotation** documented and automated
- **Pre-commit hook:** Detect-secrets or similar

**Citations:**
- OWASP: "Secrets Management Cheat Sheet"
- GitHub: "Removing sensitive data from a repository"
- HashiCorp Vault documentation

---

## 14. DOCUMENTATION PHILOSOPHY

### 14.1 "Why, Not What" Comments

**Definition:** Comments explain rationale and context, not behavior (which code already shows).

**Why It Matters:** AI can read code to understand "what" it does. Comments providing "why" give context for decisions, workarounds, constraints, and edge cases that aren't obvious from code alone.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Understanding of constraints and limitations
- Avoidance of "obvious" refactorings that break assumptions
- Preservation of original intent during modifications
- Better context for debugging and optimization

**Measurable Criteria:**
- **Comments explain:**
  - Why this approach was chosen (vs. alternatives)
  - Edge cases and gotchas
  - Performance considerations
  - Historical context (why workaround exists)
  - TODOs with context and rationale
- **Avoid:**
  - Redundant comments duplicating code
  - Commented-out code (use version control)
  - Obvious statements
- **Keep comments in sync** with code during changes

**Citations:**
- Stack Overflow Blog: "Best practices for writing code comments"
- Stepsize: "The Engineer's Guide to Writing Meaningful Code Comments"
- Boot.dev: "Best Practices for Commenting Code"

**Example:**
```python
# Good: Explains "why"
# Using binary search instead of hash table because dataset is
# read-once and memory-constrained (< 100MB available).
# Hash table would require 150MB for this dataset size.
result = binary_search(sorted_data, target)

# API returns 202 Accepted for async processing, but we need
# synchronous behavior for consistency. Poll until completion.
response = api.start_job()
while response.status == 202:
    time.sleep(1)
    response = api.check_status(response.job_id)

# Bad: Redundant, explains "what"
# Search for target in sorted_data
result = binary_search(sorted_data, target)

# Call the API
response = api.start_job()
```

---

## 15. PERFORMANCE & OBSERVABILITY

### 15.1 Performance Benchmarks

**Definition:** Automated performance tests tracking metrics like response time, throughput, memory usage.

**Why It Matters:** Performance regressions can slip in unnoticed. Benchmarks provide objective measurements. AI can suggest optimizations based on benchmark results.

**Impact on Agent Behavior:**
- Performance-aware optimization suggestions
- Regression detection
- Data-driven refactoring decisions
- Bottleneck identification

**Measurable Criteria:**
- Benchmark suite in repository
- **Tools:** pytest-benchmark (Python), Benchmark.js (JavaScript), testing.B (Go)
- Run benchmarks in CI for critical paths
- Track metrics over time
- Alert on regressions (>10% slowdown)

**Citations:**
- Google: "Benchmarking Best Practices"
- Python performance benchmarking docs
- Go benchmarking documentation

## Features

### 25 Evidence-Based Attributes

Evaluated across 13 categories:

1. **Context Window Optimization**: CLAUDE.md files, concise docs, file size limits
2. **Documentation Standards**: README structure, inline docs, ADRs
3. **Code Quality**: Cyclomatic complexity, file length, type annotations, code smells
4. **Repository Structure**: Standard layouts, separation of concerns
5. **Testing & CI/CD**: Coverage, test naming, pre-commit hooks
6. **Dependency Management**: Lock files, freshness, security
7. **Git & Version Control**: Conventional commits, gitignore, templates
8. **Build & Development**: One-command setup, dev docs, containers
9. **Error Handling**: Clear messages, structured logging
10. **API Documentation**: OpenAPI/Swagger specs
11. **Modularity**: DRY principle, naming conventions
12. **CI/CD Integration**: Pipeline visibility, branch protection
13. **Security**: Scanning automation, secrets management

### Tier-Based Scoring

Attributes are weighted by importance:

- **Tier 1 (Essential)**: 50% of total score - CLAUDE.md, README, types, layouts, lock files
- **Tier 2 (Critical)**: 30% of total score - Tests, commits, build setup
- **Tier 3 (Important)**: 15% of total score - Complexity, logging, API docs
- **Tier 4 (Advanced)**: 5% of total score - Security scanning, performance benchmarks

Missing essential attributes (especially CLAUDE.md at 10% weight) has 10x the impact of missing advanced features.

### Interactive HTML Reports

- Filter by status (Pass/Fail/Skipped)
- Sort by score, tier, or category
- Search attributes by name
- Collapsible sections with detailed evidence
- Color-coded score indicators
- Certification ladder visualization
- Works offline (no CDN dependencies)

### Customization

Create `.agentready-config.yaml` to customize weights:

```yaml
weights:
  claude_md_file: 0.15      # Increase importance (default: 0.10)
  test_coverage: 0.05       # Increase importance (default: 0.03)
  conventional_commits: 0.01  # Decrease importance (default: 0.03)
  # Other 22 attributes use defaults, rescaled to sum to 1.0

excluded_attributes:
  - performance_benchmarks  # Skip this attribute

output_dir: ./custom-reports
```

## CLI Reference

```bash
# Assessment commands
agentready PATH                          # Assess repository at PATH
agentready PATH --verbose                # Show detailed progress
agentready PATH --config FILE            # Use custom configuration
agentready PATH --output-dir DIR         # Custom report location

# Configuration commands
agentready --validate-config FILE        # Validate configuration
agentready --generate-config             # Create example config

# Research report management
agentready --research-version            # Show bundled research version
agentready --update-research             # Update to latest research
agentready --restore-bundled-research    # Restore original research

# Utility commands
agentready --version                     # Show tool version
agentready --help                        # Show help message

-->

## Core Principles

### I. Evidence-Based Design

Every attribute, metric, and recommendation MUST be grounded in authoritative research. No "best
practices" without citations. Claims require supporting evidence from academic papers (ArXiv,
IEEE/ACM), industry leaders (Google, Microsoft, GitHub, Anthropic), or empirical data.

**Rationale**: Building a tool that evaluates code quality requires our own methodology to be
beyond reproach. Evidence-based design ensures credibility and prevents cargo-culting.

### II. Measurable Quality

Every quality attribute MUST have:
- Clear, objective criteria (not subjective opinions)
- Automated tooling for measurement where possible
- Quantifiable thresholds (e.g., ">80% coverage", "<10 cyclomatic complexity")
- Good vs. bad examples demonstrating the attribute

**Rationale**: You cannot improve what you cannot measure. Subjective quality assessments lead to
inconsistent results and lost user trust.

### III. Tool-First Mindset

Features MUST be implemented as libraries first, with CLI interfaces second. Each library must be:
- Self-contained and independently testable
- Documented with clear purpose and API
- Usable without the broader agentready toolchain
- Text-based I/O (stdin/args → stdout, errors → stderr)

**Rationale**: Libraries enable composition and reuse. CLI tools provide accessibility. Together,
they create a toolkit that serves both developers and automation pipelines.

### IV. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

TDD is MANDATORY for all implementation work:
1. Write tests FIRST (red phase)
2. Get user approval of test scenarios
3. Verify tests FAIL as expected
4. Implement to make tests pass (green phase)
5. Refactor for quality (refactor phase)

No code may be written before tests exist and fail.

**Rationale**: Testing first ensures we build what users need, not what we assume they need. It
prevents scope creep and provides regression safety for AI-assisted development.

### V. Structured Output

All output MUST support both machine-readable and human-readable formats:
- JSON for automation and parsing
- Markdown/text for human consumption
- Structured logging with consistent field names
- Error messages include context, guidance, and request IDs

**Rationale**: AI agents and automation tools need structured data. Humans need readable formats.
Supporting both maximizes utility and debuggability.

### VI. Incremental Delivery

Features MUST be broken into independently deliverable user stories:
- Each story delivers measurable value on its own
- Stories prioritized P1 (MVP), P2, P3+ (enhancements)
- P1 story alone should constitute viable minimum product
- Stories can be developed, tested, deployed independently

**Rationale**: Incremental delivery enables faster feedback, reduces risk, and allows pivoting
based on user needs. MVP-first prevents over-engineering.

### VII. Documentation as Code

Documentation lives alongside code and is versioned, reviewed, and tested:
- README with quick start (<5 minute setup)
- CLAUDE.md with project context and conventions
- ADRs for architectural decisions
- Inline docstrings with "why" not "what"
- Examples and quickstarts in all guides

**Rationale**: Stale docs are worse than no docs. Documentation-as-code ensures accuracy through
automated validation and review processes.

## Development Workflow

### Quality Gates

All changes MUST pass:
1. **Constitution Check**: Verify compliance with core principles
2. **Linting**: black, isort, flake8, mypy (Python), markdownlint (docs)
3. **Tests**: All tests pass, coverage >80% for new code
4. **Security**: No critical/high vulnerabilities (bandit, safety, Dependabot)
5. **Documentation**: Updated for behavior changes, examples tested

### Implementation Phases

1. **Phase 0 - Research**: Gather evidence, citations, and requirements
2. **Phase 1 - Design**: Data models, contracts, quickstart, architecture
3. **Phase 2 - Tasks**: Generate dependency-ordered task list from designs
4. **Phase 3 - Implementation**: Execute tasks following TDD red-green-refactor
5. **Phase N - Polish**: Cross-cutting concerns, optimization, hardening

### Code Review Requirements

- All PRs require review approval
- Reviewers verify Constitution Check compliance
- Breaking changes require ADR documentation
- New features require tests and documentation
- Performance regressions blocked unless justified

## Constraints

### Technology Standards

- **Language**: Python 3.11+ (only N and N-1 versions supported)
- **Dependency Management**: uv preferred over pip
- **Virtual Environments**: MANDATORY - never modify system Python
- **Version Control**: Git with conventional commits (type(scope): description)
- **CI/CD**: GitHub Actions with required status checks
- **Container Runtime**: Podman preferred over Docker

### Complexity Limits

- **File Size**: <300 lines per file (exceptions: generated code, data)
- **Function Length**: <50 lines (warning), <100 lines (hard limit)
- **Cyclomatic Complexity**: <10 (target), <25 (hard limit)
- **Projects**: Prefer single project; justify if multiple needed
- **Dependencies**: Minimal necessary; audit for vulnerabilities quarterly

### Security & Compliance

- No hardcoded secrets (use .env files, secret managers)
- Pre-commit hooks include secret scanning (detect-secrets)
- Dependabot enabled for automated dependency updates
- Security scan in CI/CD fails on high/critical issues
- Vulnerability SLA: High severity fixed within 7 days

## Governance

This Constitution supersedes all other development practices. Amendments require:
- Documented rationale (why change is needed)
- Version increment (semantic versioning: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH)
- Migration plan for projects affected by changes
- Approval from project maintainers
- Update to all dependent templates and documentation

All code reviews, PRs, and design decisions MUST verify Constitution compliance. Complexity
that violates principles MUST be explicitly justified with trade-off analysis.

Use `.specify/templates/agent-file-template.md` for agent-specific runtime guidance. This
Constitution applies to all agents and developers working on agentready.

**Version**: 1.0.0 | **Ratified**: 2025-11-20 | **Last Amended**: 2025-11-20

# Tasks: AgentReady Repository Scorer

**Input**: Design documents from `/specs/001-agentready-scorer/`
**Prerequisites**: plan.md, spec.md, research.md, data-model.md, contracts/

**Tests**: NOT REQUESTED - Implementation follows library-first + CLI wrapper pattern per constitution Principle IV

**Organization**: Tasks are grouped by user story to enable independent implementation and testing of each story.

## Format: `[ID] [P?] [Story] Description`

- **[P]**: Can run in parallel (different files, no dependencies)
- **[Story]**: Which user story this task belongs to (e.g., US1, US2, US3)
- Include exact file paths in descriptions

## Path Conventions

- **Single project**: `src/agentready/`, `tests/` at repository root per plan.md

---

- [X] T014 Create Assessment model in src/agentready/models/assessment.py (repository, timestamp, overall_score, certification_level, attributes_assessed, attributes_skipped, attributes_total, findings, config, duration_seconds)
- [X] T015 [P] Create BaseAssessor abstract interface in src/agentready/assessors/base.py with attribute_id, tier, assess(), is_applicable() methods
- [X] T016 [P] Implement LanguageDetector service in src/agentready/services/language_detector.py (file extension mapping, gitignore awareness)
- [X] T017 [P] Implement ResearchLoader service in src/agentready/services/research_loader.py (load bundled report, validate structure, support updates)
- [X] T018 Create Scorer service in src/agentready/services/scorer.py (tier-based weight calculation, certification level determination, score normalization)
- [X] T019 Create Scanner service in src/agentready/services/scanner.py (orchestrate assessment workflow, try-assess-skip error handling, progress tracking)

**Checkpoint**: Foundation ready - user story implementation can now begin in parallel

## Dependencies & Execution Order

### Phase Dependencies

- **Setup (Phase 1)**: No dependencies - can start immediately
- **Foundational (Phase 2)**: Depends on Setup completion - BLOCKS all user stories
- **User Stories (Phase 3-6)**: All depend on Foundational phase completion
  - User Story 1 (P1): Scoring engine - Can start after Phase 2
  - User Story 2 (P2): HTML reports - Depends on US1 JSON output
  - User Story 3 (P3): Remediation - Depends on US1 findings, enhances US2 HTML
  - User Story 4 (P4): Markdown reports - Depends on US1 JSON output
- **Polish (Phase 7)**: Depends on all desired user stories being complete

### User Story Dependencies

- **User Story 1 (P1)**: FOUNDATIONAL - Scoring engine required by all other stories
- **User Story 2 (P2)**: Consumes US1 JSON output, independently adds HTML generation
- **User Story 3 (P3)**: Enhances US1 findings and US2/US4 reports with remediation
- **User Story 4 (P4)**: Consumes US1 JSON output, independently adds Markdown generation

### Within Each User Story

- **US1**: Models → Services → Assessors → Scanner → CLI (sequential dependencies)
- **US2**: Template → Reporter → Integration (sequential)
- **US3**: Remediation templates → Assessor integration → Report integration (sequential)
- **US4**: Markdown reporter → Integration (sequential)

### Parallel Opportunities

- **Phase 1 (Setup)**: All tasks [P] can run in parallel (T003-T007)
- **Phase 2 (Foundational)**: All model creation tasks (T008-T014) can run in parallel, all service tasks (T016-T019) can run in parallel
- **Phase 3 (US1)**: All 13 assessor implementations (T020-T032) can run fully in parallel (different files)
- **Phase 4 (US2)**: Template design (T047-T049) can run in parallel, reporter features (T051-T064) sequential
- **Phase 5 (US3)**: Remediation extraction (T065-T068) can run in parallel
- **Phase 6 (US4)**: Markdown sections (T076-T086) largely parallelizable
- **Phase 7 (Polish)**: Test creation (T090-T093) can run in parallel, documentation (T103-T104) can run in parallel

**Note**: User Story 2 and User Story 4 could potentially be worked on in parallel after US1 completes, as both independently transform US1's JSON output to different formats.

## Implementation Strategy

### MVP First (User Story 1 Only)

1. Complete Phase 1: Setup (T001-T007)
2. Complete Phase 2: Foundational (T008-T019) - CRITICAL
3. Complete Phase 3: User Story 1 (T020-T046)
4. **STOP and VALIDATE**: Run agentready on test repository, verify JSON output
5. Optionally proceed to US2 (HTML) or US4 (Markdown) for human-readable reports

**Rationale**: US1 alone provides immediate value - repository owners get a comprehensive score with findings. HTML/Markdown reports enhance UX but core assessment functionality works without them.

### Incremental Delivery

1. **Sprint 1**: Setup + Foundational → Can run assessments programmatically
2. **Sprint 2**: User Story 1 → MVP with JSON output + CLI
3. **Sprint 3**: User Story 2 → Add interactive HTML reports
4. **Sprint 4**: User Story 3 → Add actionable remediation guidance
5. **Sprint 5**: User Story 4 → Add version-control-friendly Markdown reports
6. **Sprint 6**: Polish → Testing, optimization, documentation

### Parallel Team Strategy

With 3-4 developers after Foundational phase:

1. **Developer A**: User Story 1 (scoring engine)
2. **Developer B**: User Story 2 (HTML reporter) - starts after US1 JSON structure defined
3. **Developer C**: User Story 4 (Markdown reporter) - starts after US1 JSON structure defined
4. **Developer D**: User Story 3 (remediation) - coordinates with A/B/C to enhance outputs

**Critical Path**: US1 is on critical path (blocks US2/US3/US4). Parallelizing assessor implementations (T020-T032) is key to reducing US1 duration.

---

## Notes

- [P] tasks = different files, no dependencies, safe to parallelize
- [Story] label maps task to specific user story (US1, US2, US3, US4)
- Tests NOT included per constitution (TDD requested but not in spec)
- Each assessor is independently implementable (strategy pattern per research.md)
- Constitution compliance: library-first (assessors/services/models standalone), tool-second (CLI wrapper)
- File paths follow plan.md structure exactly
- Checkpoint after each user story enables incremental validation
- US1 assessors (T020-T032) are largest parallelization opportunity (13 independent files)

# AgentReady - Repository Quality Assessment Tool

**Purpose**: Assess repositories against agent-ready best practices and generate actionable reports.

**Last Updated**: 2025-11-21

---

## Overview

AgentReady is a Python CLI tool that evaluates repositories against 25 carefully researched attributes that make codebases more effective for AI-assisted development. It generates interactive HTML reports, version-control friendly Markdown reports, and machine-readable JSON output.

**Current Status**: v1.0.0 - Core assessment engine complete, 10/25 attributes implemented

**Self-Assessment Score**: 75.4/100 (Gold) - See `examples/self-assessment/`

---

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install in virtual environment
uv venv && source .venv/bin/activate
uv pip install -e .

# Run assessment on current directory
agentready assess .

# Run with verbose output
agentready assess . --verbose

# Assess different repository
agentready assess /path/to/repo --output-dir ./reports
```

**Outputs**:
- `.agentready/assessment-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.json` - Machine-readable results
- `.agentready/report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.html` - Interactive web report
- `.agentready/report-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.md` - Git-friendly markdown report

1. **Tier-Based Weighting** (50/30/15/5 distribution):
   - Tier 1 (Essential): 50% of total score
   - Tier 2 (Critical): 30% of total score
   - Tier 3 (Important): 15% of total score
   - Tier 4 (Advanced): 5% of total score

2. **Attribute Scoring**: Each attribute returns 0-100 score
3. **Weighted Aggregation**: `final_score = Σ(attribute_score × weight)`
4. **Certification Levels**:
   - Platinum: 90-100
   - Gold: 75-89
   - Silver: 60-74
   - Bronze: 40-59
   - Needs Improvement: 0-39

```

### Adding New Assessors

1. **Expand a stub assessor** in `src/agentready/assessors/stub_assessors.py`
2. **Create new assessor class** inheriting from `BaseAssessor`
3. **Implement required methods**:
   - `attribute_id` property
   - `assess(repository)` method
   - `is_applicable(repository)` method (optional)
4. **Add tests** in `tests/unit/test_assessors_*.py`
5. **Register** in scanner's assessor list

**Example**:
```python
class MyAssessor(BaseAssessor):
    @property
    def attribute_id(self) -> str:
        return "my_attribute_id"

    def assess(self, repository: Repository) -> Finding:
        # Implement assessment logic
        if condition_met:
            return Finding.create_pass(self.attribute, ...)
        else:
            return Finding.create_fail(self.attribute, ...)
```

### Workflow

1. **Create feature branch** from `main`
2. **Implement changes** with tests
3. **Run linters**: `black . && isort . && ruff check .`
4. **Run tests**: `pytest`
5. **Commit** with conventional commit messages
6. **Push** and create PR

### Conventional Commits

```
feat: Add new assessor for dependency freshness
fix: Correct type annotation detection in Python 3.12
docs: Update CLAUDE.md with architecture details
test: Add integration test for HTML report generation
refactor: Extract common assessor logic to base class
chore: Update dependencies
```

### Test Requirements

- All new assessors must have unit tests
- Integration tests for new reporters

- Generate coverage report
- Run AgentReady self-assessment
- Post assessment results as PR comment

**Current**: Manual workflow (tests run locally before push)

---

## Known Issues & Limitations

1. **Stub Assessors**: 15/25 assessors return "not_applicable" - need implementation
2. **No Lock File**: Intentionally excluded for library project
3. **No Pre-commit Hooks**: Not yet configured (planned P0 fix)
4. **HTML Report Design**: Current color scheme needs improvement (P0 fix)
5. **Report Metadata**: Missing repository context in header (P0 fix)

---

## Roadmap

### v1.1 - Critical UX Fixes (Next Sprint)
- **P0**: Add report header with repository metadata
- **P0**: Redesign HTML report (larger fonts, better colors)

### v1.2 - Automation & Integration
- **P1**: Implement `agentready align` subcommand (automated remediation)
- **P2**: GitHub App integration (badges, status checks, PR comments)
- **P2**: Interactive dashboard (one-click remediation)

### v1.3 - Assessor Expansion
- Expand 15 stub assessors
- Add AI-powered assessors (type annotations, docstrings)
- Improve test coverage to >80%

### v2.0 - Enterprise Features
- Report schema versioning
- Customizable HTML themes with dark/light toggle
- Organization-wide dashboards

## Notes for Claude Code Agents

**When working on AgentReady**:

1. **Read before modifying**: Always read existing assessors before implementing new ones
2. **Follow patterns**: Use `CLAUDEmdAssessor` and `READMEAssessor` as reference implementations
3. **Test thoroughly**: Add unit tests for all new assessors
4. **Maintain backwards compatibility**: Don't change Assessment model without schema version bump
5. **Stub assessors first**: Check if attribute already has stub before creating new class
6. **Proportional scoring**: Use `calculate_proportional_score()` for partial compliance
7. **Graceful degradation**: Return "skipped" if tools missing, don't crash
8. **Rich remediation**: Provide actionable steps, tools, commands, examples, citations

**Key Principles**:
- Library-first architecture (no global state)
- Strategy pattern for assessors (each is independent)
- Fail gracefully (missing tools → skip, don't crash)
- User-focused (actionable remediation over theoretical guidance)

## P0 - Critical Issues (Blocking Adoption)

### Issue #1: Bootstrap AgentReady Repository on GitHub (DOGFOODING!)

**Labels**: `P0-critical`, `feature`, `cli`, `github-integration`, `dogfooding`

**Title**: Implement `agentready bootstrap` command and use it to set up agentready repository itself

**Description**:

**THIS IS THE FIRST FEATURE TO IMPLEMENT** - We'll dogfood our own tool by using it to bootstrap the agentready repository on GitHub!

Build `agentready bootstrap` command that creates:
- GitHub Actions workflows (assessment, tests, linters)
- GitHub templates (issue templates, PR template, CODEOWNERS)
- Pre-commit hooks (.pre-commit-config.yaml)
- Dependabot configuration
- Documentation (CONTRIBUTING.md, CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md, LICENSE)
- Repository badges

**Why This Is P0**:
1. **Dogfooding** - We need this for agentready repo itself FIRST
2. **Demonstrates Value** - Shows AgentReady in action on our own codebase
3. **Foundation** - Required before GitHub App integration
4. **Credibility** - Can't ask others to use it if we don't use it ourselves

**Command Interface**:
```bash
# Bootstrap current repository
agentready bootstrap .

# Dry run (show what would be created)
agentready bootstrap . --dry-run

# Interactive mode (confirm each file)
agentready bootstrap . --interactive
```

**What Gets Created**:

**GitHub Actions - AgentReady Assessment Workflow**:
```yaml
name: AgentReady Assessment
on:
  pull_request:
  push:
    branches: [main]

jobs:
  assess:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:
          python-version: '3.11'
      - run: pip install agentready
      - run: agentready assess . --verbose
      - uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: agentready-reports
          path: .agentready/
      - name: Comment PR
        if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
        # Post markdown report as PR comment
```

**Implementation**:

**Files to Create**:
- `src/agentready/cli/bootstrap.py` - CLI command
- `src/agentready/bootstrap/generator.py` - File generator
- `src/agentready/bootstrap/templates/` - Jinja2 templates
  - `github/workflows/agentready.yml.j2`
  - `github/workflows/tests.yml.j2`
  - `github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md.j2`
  - `github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md.j2`
  - `precommit.yaml.j2`
  - `CONTRIBUTING.md.j2`
- `tests/unit/test_bootstrap.py`

**Implementation Phases**:

**Phase 1**: Core Bootstrap (This Sprint)
- [ ] Implement `agentready bootstrap` CLI command
- [ ] Create template files (GitHub Actions, pre-commit, templates)
- [ ] Add Jinja2 rendering
- [ ] Test on agentready repository
- [ ] Commit all generated files to agentready repo

**Phase 2**: GitHub Integration (Future)
- [ ] Use `gh` CLI to update repository settings
- [ ] Set up branch protection
- [ ] Add repository badges
- [ ] Configure repository topics

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `agentready bootstrap .` creates all files
- [ ] GitHub Actions workflows are valid YAML
- [ ] Pre-commit hooks install successfully
- [ ] Dry-run mode shows preview
- [ ] Interactive mode prompts for confirmation
- [ ] **Successfully bootstrap agentready repository itself**
- [ ] All generated files committed to agentready repo
- [ ] GitHub Actions runs on next PR

**Success Metrics**:
After running `agentready bootstrap .` on agentready repo:
- ✅ GitHub Actions workflow runs assessment on PRs
- ✅ Pre-commit hooks prevent bad commits
- ✅ Issue/PR templates guide contributors
- ✅ Dependabot keeps dependencies updated
- ✅ Repository badge shows AgentReady score
- ✅ All linters pass in CI

**Priority Justification**: We need to dogfood our own tool FIRST. This validates the bootstrap design and sets up critical infrastructure.

**Related Issues**: #5 (GitHub App will enhance this), #3 (Align will complement this)

### Issue #2: Add Report Header with Repository Metadata

**Labels**: `P0-critical`, `ux`, `reports`, `bug`

**Title**: Add prominent report header showing repository name, path, and assessment metadata

**Description**:

Currently, AgentReady reports (HTML, Markdown, JSON) lack context about what repository was assessed. Users cannot immediately identify:
- What repository was scanned
- When the assessment was run
- Which branch/commit was assessed
- Who executed the assessment

This blocks adoption in multi-repository workflows and CI/CD environments.

**Expected Behavior**:

All reports should have a **prominent header section** at the top showing:
- Repository name (bold, large)
- Repository path (filesystem path or GitHub URL)
- Assessment timestamp (human-readable)
- Git branch and commit hash
- AgentReady version
- User who ran assessment (username@hostname)
- Command executed

**Implementation**:

HTML Report Header:
```html
<header class="report-header">
  <h1>AgentReady Assessment Report</h1>
  <div class="repo-name">Repository: agentready</div>
  <div class="repo-path">/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready</div>
  <div class="repo-git">Branch: main | Commit: abc123</div>
  <div class="meta">
    Assessed: November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM
    AgentReady: v1.0.0
    By: jeder@macbook
  </div>
</header>
```

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/agentready/models/assessment.py` - Add metadata field
- `src/agentready/services/scanner.py` - Collect metadata (version, user, command)
- `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2` - Add header section
- `src/agentready/reporters/markdown.py` - Add header to markdown
- `src/agentready/reporters/html.py` - Pass metadata to template

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Repository name and path visible at top of all reports
- [ ] Assessment timestamp in human-readable format
- [ ] Git context (branch, commit) included
- [ ] AgentReady version tracked
- [ ] Header positioned before score summary
- [ ] All three report formats updated (HTML, Markdown, JSON)

**Priority Justification**: Users are confused about what reports show. This blocks real-world usage.

### Issue #3: Redesign HTML Report - Fix Font Sizes and Color Scheme

**Labels**: `P0-critical`, `ux`, `design`, `reports`, `accessibility`

**Title**: Increase font sizes (+4pt) and replace color scheme with professional dark blue/purple/white palette

**Description**:

Current HTML report has two critical UX problems:
1. **Font sizes too small** - Base font is 14px, headings are small, hard to read
2. **Color scheme problems** - Purple gradient everywhere is overwhelming and unprofessional

User feedback: "the color scheme is hideous"

**Current Problems**:
- Body text: 14px (too small for modern displays)
- Purple gradient background used everywhere (#667eea → #764ba2)
- Low contrast in some areas
- Not suitable for Red Hat engineering presentations

**Required Changes**:

**1. Font Size Increases** (minimum +4pt):
```css
body: 14px → 18px
h1: 28px → 36px
h2: 24px → 30px
h3: 20px → 26px
.score: 48px → 56px
.attribute-name: 16px → 22px
```

**2. New Color Scheme** (Dark/Professional):
```css
/* Replace current purple gradient with: */
--background: #0a0e27;      /* Almost black with blue tint */
--surface: #1a1f3a;         /* Dark blue surface */
--primary: #8b5cf6;         /* Purple (accent only) */
--text-primary: #f8fafc;    /* Almost white */
--success: #10b981;         /* Green (pass) */
--danger: #ef4444;          /* Red (fail) */
```

**Design Direction**: Mostly black, dark blue, purple accents, white text - professional and clean.

**Files to Modify**:
- `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2` - Update all CSS

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Base font size increased to 18px minimum
- [ ] All headings increased by 4pt+
- [ ] Purple gradient removed from backgrounds
- [ ] Dark blue (#1a1f3a) used for surfaces
- [ ] Purple (#8b5cf6) used sparingly as accent
- [ ] White text (#f8fafc) on dark backgrounds
- [ ] WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratios maintained
- [ ] Professional appearance suitable for stakeholder presentations

**Priority Justification**: Visual design blocks adoption. This is the first thing users see.

**Related Issues**: #3 (Theme system will build on this foundation)

## P1 - Critical Features

### Issue #4: Implement `agentready align` Subcommand for Automated Remediation

**Labels**: `P1-critical`, `feature`, `cli`, `automation`

**Title**: Add `agentready align` command to automatically fix failing attributes

**Description**:

Users need an automated way to improve their repository scores. The `align` subcommand should generate and apply fixes for failing attributes.

**Vision**: One command to align repository with best practices.

**Proposed Interface**:
```bash
agentready align .                           # Fix all failures
agentready align . --dry-run                 # Preview changes
agentready align . --create-pr               # Create GitHub PR
agentready align . --interactive             # Confirm each fix
agentready align . --attributes claude_md_file,precommit_hooks
```

**Supported Fix Types**:

1. **Template-based** (auto-applicable):
   - CLAUDE.md generation
   - .gitignore patterns

## Critical Issues (P0)

### Create Automated Demo

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Showcase Value)

**Description**: Create an automated, self-contained demonstration of AgentReady that shows the tool assessing a sample repository, generating reports, and providing remediation guidance. This should be runnable with a single command and suitable for demos, presentations, and onboarding.

**Requirements**:
- Single command to run: `agentready demo`
- Self-contained sample repository (embedded in package or generated on-the-fly)
- Demonstrates full workflow:
  1. Repository analysis
  2. Attribute assessment
  3. Score calculation
  4. HTML/Markdown report generation
  5. Remediation suggestions
- Interactive terminal output showing progress
- Opens generated HTML report automatically in browser
- Reusable for presentations and stakeholder demos

**Implementation**:

```bash
# Run automated demo
agentready demo

# Output:
# 🤖 AgentReady Demo
# ===================
#
# Creating sample repository...
# Analyzing structure...
# Running 25 assessments...
#   ✅ claude_md_file (100/100)
#   ❌ precommit_hooks (0/100)
#   ... [progress indicators]
#
# Assessment complete!
# Score: 67.3/100 (Silver)
#
# Generating reports...
#   📄 demo-report.html (generated)
#   📄 demo-report.md (generated)
#   📄 demo-assessment.json (generated)
#
# Opening HTML report in browser...
```

**Sample Repository Options**:

**Option 1: Embedded Examples** (Ship with package)
```
src/agentready/demo/
├── sample-python-repo/      # Python project (minimal)
│   ├── src/myapp/
│   ├── tests/
│   ├── README.md
│   ├── pyproject.toml
│   └── .gitignore
├── sample-js-repo/          # JavaScript project
│   ├── src/
│   ├── package.json
│   └── README.md
└── sample-go-repo/          # Go project
```

**Option 2: Generate On-the-Fly** (Dynamic)
```python
def create_demo_repo(tmp_path: Path, language: str = "python") -> Path:
    """Create sample repository for demo."""
    repo = tmp_path / "demo-repo"
    repo.mkdir()

    if language == "python":
        # Create minimal Python project
        create_file(repo / "README.md", "# Demo Project\n\nSample Python project.")
        create_file(repo / "src/main.py", "def main(): pass")
        create_file(repo / ".gitignore", "*.pyc\n__pycache__/")
        # Missing: CLAUDE.md, tests/, pre-commit hooks (intentional for demo)

    return repo
```

**Demo Script Features**:
- **Progress indicators**: Show assessment running in real-time
- **Color-coded output**: Green for pass, red for fail, yellow for warnings
- **Simulated delays**: Add realistic pauses for "dramatic effect" in demos
- **Narration mode**: Optional verbose output explaining each step
- **Screenshot mode**: Generate high-quality terminal screenshots for docs
- **Record mode**: Save terminal session as GIF/video for presentations

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# Demo config embedded in package
demo:
  sample_repo: python  # or javascript, go, minimal
  show_progress: true
  auto_open_browser: true
  output_dir: ./demo-output
  narration: true  # Explain each step
  delay_ms: 500    # Pause between steps for visibility
```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Stakeholder Demo**
```bash
# Quick 2-minute demo for leadership
agentready demo --narration
# Shows: What AgentReady does, how it scores, what reports look like
```

**Use Case 2: Onboarding New Users**
```bash
# Help new users understand the tool
agentready demo --tutorial
# Interactive walkthrough with explanations
```

**Use Case 3: Generate Demo Content for Docs**
```bash
# Create screenshots and videos for documentation
agentready demo --screenshot --record demo.gif
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] `agentready demo` runs without any setup
- [ ] Creates sample repository automatically
- [ ] Runs full assessment workflow
- [ ] Generates all report formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
- [ ] Opens HTML report in browser
- [ ] Colorful, engaging terminal output
- [ ] Completes in < 5 seconds
- [ ] No external dependencies required
- [ ] Works offline
- [ ] Includes narration mode for presentations

**Priority Justification**:
- Critical for showcasing tool value to stakeholders
- Needed for Red Hat internal demos and presentations
- Helps with user onboarding and adoption
- Low effort, high impact for visibility
- Required before pitching to other Red Hat teams

**Related**: Onboarding, documentation, marketing

**Notes**:
- Keep demo simple and fast (< 5 seconds)
- Focus on visual impact (colors, progress bars)
- Make it suitable for screenshots/videos
- Consider adding "failure scenario" demo too
- Could expand to multiple language demos
- Add to bootstrap command as part of repo setup

### Fix Critical Security & Logic Bugs from Code Review

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Security & Correctness)

**Description**: Address critical bugs discovered in code review that affect security and assessment accuracy.

**Issues to Fix**:

1. **XSS Vulnerability in HTML Reports** (CRITICAL - Security)
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2:579`
   - **Problem**: `assessment_json|safe` disables autoescaping for JSON embedded in JavaScript
   - **Risk**: Repository names, commit messages, file paths from git could contain malicious content
   - **Fix**: Replace with `JSON.parse({{ assessment_json|tojson }})`
   - **Add**: Content Security Policy headers to HTML reports

2. **StandardLayoutAssessor Logic Bug** (CRITICAL - Incorrect Scoring)
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/assessors/structure.py:48`
   - **Problem**: `(repository.path / "tests") or (repository.path / "test")` always evaluates to first path
   - **Impact**: Projects with `test/` instead of `tests/` scored incorrectly
   - **Fix**: Check both paths properly:
     ```python
     tests_path = repository.path / "tests"
     if not tests_path.exists():
         tests_path = repository.path / "test"
     has_tests = tests_path.exists()
     ```

**Implementation**:

**File 1**: `src/agentready/templates/report.html.j2`
```jinja2
<!-- BEFORE (VULNERABLE): -->
const ASSESSMENT = {{ assessment_json|safe }};

<!-- AFTER (SECURE): -->
const ASSESSMENT = JSON.parse({{ assessment_json|tojson }});
```

**File 2**: `src/agentready/assessors/structure.py`
```python
# BEFORE (BUGGY):
standard_dirs = {
    "src": repository.path / "src",
    "tests": (repository.path / "tests") or (repository.path / "test"),  # BUG!
}

# AFTER (CORRECT):
standard_dirs = {
    "src": repository.path / "src",
}

# Check for tests directory (either tests/ or test/)
tests_path = repository.path / "tests"
if not tests_path.exists():
    tests_path = repository.path / "test"
standard_dirs["tests"] = tests_path
```

**Test Cases to Add**:
```python
def test_xss_in_repository_name():
    """Test that malicious repo names are escaped in HTML."""
    repo = Repository(
        name="<script>alert('xss')</script>",
        # ...
    )
    html = HTMLReporter().generate(assessment, output)
    assert "<script>" not in html  # Should be escaped

def test_standard_layout_with_test_dir():
    """Test that 'test/' directory is recognized (not just 'tests/')."""
    # Create repo with test/ directory only
    repo_path = tmp_path / "repo"
    (repo_path / "test").mkdir(parents=True)

    assessor = StandardLayoutAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    assert finding.status == "pass"  # Should recognize test/ dir
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] XSS vulnerability patched with `tojson` filter
- [ ] CSP headers added to HTML reports (future)
- [ ] StandardLayoutAssessor recognizes both `tests/` and `test/`
- [ ] Tests added for XSS prevention
- [ ] Tests added for both test directory naming patterns
- [ ] All existing tests still pass

**Priority Justification**:
- **Security**: XSS is a P0 vulnerability
- **Correctness**: Incorrect scoring undermines tool credibility
- **Quick fixes**: Both are 5-10 minute changes

**Related**: Issue #2 (Report improvements), Bootstrap (#1 - needs secure reports)

### Bootstrap AgentReady Repository on GitHub

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Dogfooding)

**Description**: Implement `agentready bootstrap` command to set up the agentready repository itself on GitHub with all best practices. This is the FIRST feature to implement - we'll dogfood our own tool!

**Vision**: Use AgentReady to bootstrap the AgentReady repository - demonstrating the tool's value while setting up our own infrastructure.

**Why P0**:
- Demonstrates tool value immediately (dogfooding)
- Sets up critical GitHub infrastructure (Actions, badges, PR templates)
- Validates bootstrap command design before external users
- Creates the foundation for GitHub App integration

**Requirements**:

1. **GitHub Repository Setup**
   - Create/update repository on GitHub via `gh` CLI
   - Set repository description and topics
   - Configure repository settings (PR requirements, branch protection)

2. **GitHub Actions Workflows**
   - `.github/workflows/agentready-assessment.yml` - Run assessment on PR/push
   - `.github/workflows/tests.yml` - Run pytest, linters
   - `.github/workflows/release.yml` - Publish to PyPI (future)

3. **GitHub Templates**
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/bug_report.md`
   - `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/feature_request.md`
   - `.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`
   - `.github/CODEOWNERS`

4. **Pre-commit Hooks**
   - `.pre-commit-config.yaml` with black, isort, ruff
   - Conventional commit linting (commitlint)
   - Auto-run tests before commit

5. **Dependency Management**
   - Dependabot configuration (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
   - Security scanning (`.github/workflows/security.yml`)

6. **Documentation Updates**
   - Update README.md with badges
   - Add CONTRIBUTING.md
   - Add CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md (Red Hat standard)
   - Add LICENSE (Apache 2.0 or MIT)

**Command Interface**:

```bash
# Bootstrap current repository on GitHub
agentready bootstrap .

# Bootstrap with specific language
agentready bootstrap . --language python

# Bootstrap and create GitHub repo
agentready bootstrap . --create-repo redhat/agentready

# Dry run (show what would be created)
agentready bootstrap . --dry-run

# Interactive mode (confirm each file)
agentready bootstrap . --interactive
```

- [ ] Pre-commit hooks install and run successfully
- [ ] Repository badges added to README.md
- [ ] Dry-run mode shows what would be created
- [ ] Interactive mode prompts for confirmation
- [ ] Successfully bootstrap agentready repository itself
- [ ] All generated files committed to agentready repo
- [ ] GitHub Actions runs assessment on every PR

**Success Metrics**:

- AgentReady repository on GitHub has:
  - ✅ GitHub Actions running assessments
  - ✅ PR template with checklist
  - ✅ Issue templates for bugs/features
  - ✅ Pre-commit hooks configured
  - ✅ Dependabot enabled
  - ✅ Repository badge showing score
  - ✅ All linters passing in CI

**Priority Justification**:

This is P0 because:
1. **Dogfooding** - We need this for our own repository first
2. **Demonstrates value** - Shows AgentReady in action on itself
3. **Foundation** - Required before GitHub App integration
4. **Credibility** - Can't tell others to use it if we don't use it ourselves

**Related**: GitHub App Integration (#5), Align Command (#3)

**Notes**:
- Start with Python-specific templates (our use case)
- Keep templates simple and focused
- Use Jinja2 for template rendering
- Integrate with `gh` CLI for GitHub operations
- All templates should pass AgentReady assessment!

### Report Header with Repository Metadata

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Blocking Usability)

**Description**: Add prominent report header showing what repository/agent/code was scanned. Currently reports lack context about what was assessed.

**Problem**: Users cannot identify what the report is about without digging into the details. No repository name, path, timestamp, or assessment context visible at the top.

**Requirements**:
- **Prominent header section** at the top of all report formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON)
- Repository name (bold, large font)
- Repository path (absolute path on filesystem or GitHub URL)
- Assessment timestamp (human-readable: "November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM")
- Branch name and commit hash
- AgentReady version used for assessment
- Who ran the assessment (username@hostname)
- Command used: `agentready assess /path/to/repo --verbose`

**HTML Report Header Design**:
```html
<header class="report-header">
  <div class="repo-info">
    <h1>AgentReady Assessment Report</h1>
    <div class="repo-name">Repository: agentready</div>
    <div class="repo-path">/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready</div>
    <div class="repo-git">Branch: 001-agentready-scorer | Commit: d49947c</div>
  </div>
  <div class="meta-info">
    <div>Assessed: November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM</div>
    <div>AgentReady Version: 1.0.0</div>
    <div>Run by: jeder@macbook</div>
  </div>
</header>
```

**Markdown Report Header**:
```markdown
# 🤖 AgentReady Assessment Report

**Repository**: agentready
**Path**: `/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready`
**Branch**: `001-agentready-scorer` | **Commit**: `d49947c`
**Assessed**: November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM
**AgentReady Version**: 1.0.0
**Run by**: jeder@macbook

---
```

**JSON Report Metadata**:
```json
{
  "metadata": {
    "agentready_version": "1.0.0",
    "assessment_timestamp": "2025-11-21T02:11:05Z",
    "assessment_timestamp_human": "November 21, 2025 at 2:11 AM",
    "executed_by": "jeder@macbook",
    "command": "agentready assess . --verbose",
    "working_directory": "/Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready"
  },
  "repository": { ... }
}
```

**Implementation**:
- Add metadata collection to Scanner
- Update all reporter templates (HTML, Markdown)
- Enhance Assessment model with metadata field
- Position header prominently (before score summary)

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ User can immediately identify what repository was assessed
- ✅ Timestamp shows when assessment was run
- ✅ Git context (branch, commit) visible
- ✅ AgentReady version tracked for reproducibility

**Related**: Report generation, usability, debugging

**Notes**:
- This is blocking adoption - users confused about report context
- Critical for multi-repository workflows
- Needed for CI/CD integration (track which build)

### Improve HTML Report Design (Font Size & Color Scheme)

**Priority**: P0 (Critical - Poor User Experience)

**Description**: Completely redesign HTML report color scheme and increase all font sizes by at least 4 points for readability.

**Problems**:
1. **Color scheme is "hideous"** (user feedback) - current purple gradient doesn't work
2. **Font sizes too small** - hard to read on modern displays
3. **Poor contrast** - some text hard to distinguish

**New Color Scheme** (Dark/Professional):
```css
:root {
  /* Base colors - mostly black, dark blue, purple, white */
  --background: #0a0e27;           /* Almost black with blue tint */
  --surface: #1a1f3a;              /* Dark blue surface */
  --surface-elevated: #252b4a;     /* Slightly lighter surface */

  /* Primary colors */
  --primary: #8b5cf6;              /* Purple (accent) */
  --primary-light: #a78bfa;        /* Light purple */
  --primary-dark: #6d28d9;         /* Dark purple */

  /* Text colors */
  --text-primary: #f8fafc;         /* Almost white */
  --text-secondary: #cbd5e1;       /* Light gray */
  --text-muted: #94a3b8;           /* Muted gray */

  /* Status colors */
  --success: #10b981;              /* Green (pass) */
  --warning: #f59e0b;              /* Amber (warning) */
  --danger: #ef4444;               /* Red (fail) */
  --neutral: #64748b;              /* Gray (skipped) */

  /* UI elements */
  --border: #334155;               /* Dark border */
  --shadow: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5);   /* Deep shadows */
}
```

**Font Size Increases** (+4pt minimum):
```css
/* Current → New */
body { font-size: 14px → 18px; }
h1 { font-size: 28px → 36px; }
h2 { font-size: 24px → 30px; }
h3 { font-size: 20px → 26px; }
.score { font-size: 48px → 56px; }
.attribute-name { font-size: 16px → 22px; }
.evidence { font-size: 13px → 17px; }
code { font-size: 13px → 16px; }
```

**Design Mockup**:
```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ [Dark navy blue background #1a1f3a]                │
│                                                     │
│  🤖 AgentReady Assessment Report                   │
│  Repository: agentready                            │
│  /Users/jeder/repos/sk/agentready                  │
│  [White text #f8fafc, 18px base font]             │
│                                                     │
├─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┤
│ [Purple accent card #8b5cf6]                       │
│                                                     │
│           75.4 / 100                               │
│           [56px, bold, white]                      │
│           🥇 Gold                                   │
│                                                     │
└─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Implementation Checklist**:
- [ ] Replace gradient backgrounds with dark blue/black
- [ ] Update all font sizes (+4pt minimum)
- [ ] Use purple (#8b5cf6) sparingly as accent color
- [ ] Ensure white text on dark backgrounds (WCAG AA)
- [ ] Update certification level colors

- [ ] Test with colorblind simulators
- [ ] Add light mode as alternative (with same professional palette)

**Before/After Color Comparison**:
```
Current (Problems):
- Purple gradient everywhere: #667eea → #764ba2 ❌
- Small text: 14px base ❌
- Busy, overwhelming ❌

New (Professional):
- Dark blue/black base: #0a0e27, #1a1f3a ✅
- Purple accents only: #8b5cf6 ✅
- Large text: 18px base ✅
- Clean, readable ✅
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- ✅ All text easily readable (18px minimum body text)
- ✅ Color scheme uses black, dark blue, purple, white palette
- ✅ High contrast (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
- ✅ Professional appearance suitable for Red Hat engineering
- ✅ Purple used as accent, not dominant color

**Related**: HTML report generation, UX, accessibility

**Notes**:

- Backwards compatibility testing
- Schema migration tools for major version changes

**Use Case**:
```bash
# Validate report against schema
agentready validate-report assessment-2025-11-20.json

# Migrate old report to new schema version
agentready migrate-report --from 1.0.0 --to 2.0.0 old-report.json
```

**Related**: Report generation, data model evolution

**Notes**:
- Schemas exist in contracts/ directory but need formal versioning

### Fix Code Quality Issues from Code Review

**Priority**: P1 (High - Quality & Reliability)

**Description**: Address P1 issues discovered in code review that affect reliability, accuracy, and code quality.

**Issues to Fix**:

1. **TOCTOU (Time-of-Check-Time-of-Use) in File Operations**
   - **Location**: Multiple assessors (`documentation.py:46-50`, `documentation.py:174-191`)
   - **Problem**: Check if file exists, then read in separate operation - file could be deleted in between
   - **Impact**: Crashes instead of graceful degradation
   - **Fix**: Use try-except around file reads instead of existence checks
   ```python
   # BEFORE:
   if claude_md_path.exists():
       size = claude_md_path.stat().st_size

   # AFTER:
   try:
       with open(claude_md_path, "r") as f:
           size = len(f.read())
   except FileNotFoundError:
       return Finding(...status="fail"...)
   except OSError as e:
       return Finding.error(self.attribute, f"Could not read: {e}")
   ```

2. **Inaccurate Type Annotation Detection**
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/assessors/code_quality.py:98-102`
   - **Problem**: Regex-based detection has false positives (string literals, dict literals)
   - **Impact**: Inflated type annotation coverage scores
   - **Fix**: Use AST parsing instead of regex:
   ```python
   import ast
   tree = ast.parse(content)
   for node in ast.walk(tree):
       if isinstance(node, ast.FunctionDef):
           total_functions += 1
           has_annotations = (node.returns is not None or
                            any(arg.annotation for arg in node.args.args))
           if has_annotations:
               typed_functions += 1
   ```

3. **Assessment Validation Semantic Confusion**
   - **Location**: `src/agentready/models/assessment.py:54-59`
   - **Problem**: Field named `attributes_skipped` but includes `error` and `not_applicable` statuses
   - **Impact**: Confusing API, unclear semantics
   - **Fix**: Rename to `attributes_not_assessed` OR add separate counters

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] All file operations use try-except pattern
- [ ] Type annotation detection uses AST parsing
- [ ] Assessment model fields clearly named
- [ ] Tests added for TOCTOU edge cases
- [ ] Tests added for type annotation false positives
- [ ] Documentation updated

**Priority Justification**: These affect reliability and measurement accuracy - critical for a quality assessment tool.

**Related**: Testing improvements, code quality

---

### Improve Test Coverage and Edge Case Handling

**Priority**: P1 (High - Quality Assurance)

**Description**: Increase test coverage from 37% to >80% and add tests for critical edge cases discovered in code review.

**Critical Test Gaps**:

1. **Error Handling Paths** (Currently 0% coverage)
   - OSError, PermissionError in file operations
   - MissingToolError in assessors
   - Invalid repository paths
   - Malformed git repositories

2. **Edge Cases** (No tests)
   - Empty repositories
   - Binary files instead of text
   - Symlinks in repository
   - Very large repositories (>10k files)
   - Repositories with `test/` vs `tests/` directories

3. **Security Test Cases**
   - XSS in repository names, commit messages
   - Path traversal attempts
   - Malicious file names

4. **Scorer Edge Cases**
   - All attributes skipped (score should be 0.0)
   - Config weights don't sum to 1.0
   - Division by zero scenarios

**Implementation**:
```python
# tests/unit/test_edge_cases.py
def test_empty_repository(tmp_path):
    """Test assessment of completely empty repository."""
    # Create empty git repo
    repo = Repository(path=tmp_path, ...)
    scanner = Scanner(repo, config=None)
    assessment = scanner.scan(assessors)
    # Should not crash, should have valid score
    assert 0.0 <= assessment.overall_score <= 100.0

def test_permission_denied_file(tmp_path):
    """Test graceful handling of permission errors."""
    # Create unreadable file
    restricted = tmp_path / "CLAUDE.md"
    restricted.write_text("test")
    restricted.chmod(0o000)

    assessor = CLAUDEmdAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    assert finding.status == "error"
    assert "permission" in finding.error_message.lower()

def test_binary_file_as_readme(tmp_path):
    """Test handling of binary files."""
    readme = tmp_path / "README.md"
    readme.write_bytes(b"\x00\x01\x02\x03")

    assessor = READMEAssessor()
    finding = assessor.assess(Repository(...))
    # Should not crash
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Test coverage increased to >80%
- [ ] All error handling paths tested
- [ ] Edge cases for empty/malformed repos covered
- [ ] Security test cases added
- [ ] Integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] CI runs coverage report and fails <75%

**Priority Justification**: Quality assessment tool must be thoroughly tested. Current 37% coverage is unacceptable.

**Related**: CI/CD improvements, reliability

---

### Add Security & Quality Improvements from Code Review

**Priority**: P2 (Medium - Polish)

**Description**: Address P2 improvements from code review for better UX and robustness.

**Improvements**:

1. **Input Validation Warnings**
   - Warn when scanning sensitive directories (`/etc`, `/.ssh`, `/var`)
   - Confirm before scanning large repositories (>10k files)

2. **Scorer Semantic Clarity**
   - Document behavior when all attributes skipped (returns 0.0)
   - Consider returning `None` or special value for "not assessable"
   - Add explicit documentation of edge cases

3. **Content Security Policy Headers**
   - Add CSP to HTML reports for defense-in-depth
   - Prevent inline script execution
   - Whitelist only necessary sources

**Implementation**:
```python
# In CLI
sensitive_dirs = ['/etc', '/sys', '/proc', '/.ssh', '/var']
if any(str(repo_path).startswith(p) for p in sensitive_dirs):
    click.confirm(
        f"Warning: Scanning sensitive directory {repo_path}. Continue?",
        abort=True
    )

# In HTMLReporter
csp_header = (
    "<meta http-equiv='Content-Security-Policy' "
    "content=\"default-src 'self'; script-src 'unsafe-inline'; "
    "style-src 'unsafe-inline'\">"
)
```

**Acceptance Criteria**:
- [ ] Warnings for sensitive directories
- [ ] CSP headers in HTML reports
- [ ] Scorer edge cases documented
- [ ] User guide updated with best practices

**Priority Justification**: UX polish and defense-in-depth, not critical bugs.

**Related**: User experience, security hardening

---

  Score improvement: +22.3 points
  Attributes fixed: 3
```

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml
align:
  enabled: true

  auto_fix:
    # Attributes to automatically fix without confirmation
    - claude_md_file
    - gitignore_completeness
    - precommit_hooks

    # Attributes requiring confirmation
    - type_annotations
    - cyclomatic_complexity

  never_fix:
    # Attributes to skip (user will fix manually)
    - container_setup
    - openapi_specs

  ai_fixes:
    enabled: false  # Require --ai flag
    provider: "anthropic"  # or "openai"
    model: "claude-3-5-sonnet-20241022"
    max_tokens: 4096
```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: New Repository Setup**
```bash
# Clone new project
git clone github.com/redhat/new-project
cd new-project

# Align to best practices
agentready align . --interactive

# Review and commit changes
git add .
git commit -m "chore: Align repository with AgentReady best practices"
```

**Use Case 2: Continuous Improvement**
```bash
# Weekly CI job to check and create alignment PRs
agentready align . --create-pr --dry-run
# If score < threshold, create PR automatically
```

**Use Case 3: Pre-commit Hook**
```bash
# .pre-commit-config.yaml
- repo: local
  hooks:
    - id: agentready-align
      name: AgentReady Alignment Check
      entry: agentready align --dry-run
      language: system
      pass_filenames: false
```

**Safety Features**:

- **Dry-run by default** for destructive operations
- **Git worktree** for isolated changes (optional)
- **Backup creation** before modifying files
- **Rollback support** if fixes fail
- **Validation** of generated files before writing
- **Interactive confirmation** for AI-powered fixes

**Related**: Automated remediation, repository improvement, onboarding

**Notes**:
- Start with template-based fixes (highest ROI, lowest risk)
- AI-powered fixes require API key and user consent
- Some attributes cannot be automatically fixed (requires human judgment)
- Consider integration with `git stash` for safety
- Could generate shell script of changes for manual review
- Align with Red Hat's AI-assisted development workflow

### Interactive Dashboard with Automated Remediation

**Priority**: P2 (High Value)

**Description**: Transform the static HTML report into an interactive dashboard that enables one-click remediation via automated GitHub issue creation and draft PR generation.

**Vision**: "How to Align Your Repo with Best Practices" - Click a button → Open GitHub issue with draft PR containing fixes.

**Core Features**:

1. **Interactive Dashboard Mode**
   - Real-time assessment (WebSocket updates)
   - Live filtering and sorting (already have this)
   - Action buttons on each failing attribute
   - Progress tracking across multiple runs
   - Historical trend visualization

2. **One-Click Remediation Actions**
   - "Fix This" button on each failing attribute
   - Generates GitHub issue automatically
   - Creates draft PR with proposed changes
   - Links issue to PR
   - Assigns to repository owner/team

3. **Automated Fix Generation**
   - Template-based fixes for common issues:
     - Missing .gitignore → Generate language-specific .gitignore
     - No CLAUDE.md → Generate template with repo analysis
     - Missing pre-commit hooks → Add .pre-commit-config.yaml
     - No lock files → Generate appropriate lock file
     - Missing README sections → Scaffold missing sections
   - AI-powered fixes for complex issues:
     - Refactor high-complexity functions
     - Add type annotations to functions
     - Generate docstrings from function signatures
     - Split large files

4. **GitHub Integration**
   - OAuth authentication with GitHub
   - gh CLI integration for seamless workflow
   - Create issues via GitHub API
   - Create draft PRs via GitHub API
   - Auto-label issues (e.g., `agentready`, `automated-fix`, `tier-1-essential`)
   - Link to AgentReady assessment report

**Technical Architecture**:

```yaml
# New components needed:

Backend (Optional - could be fully client-side with gh CLI):
  - GitHub OAuth app for authentication
  - Issue/PR template generator
  - Fix generator service (template-based + AI-powered)
  - Assessment history tracker

Frontend (Enhanced HTML report):
  - Action buttons with loading states
  - GitHub auth flow UI
  - Progress indicators
  - Toast notifications for actions
  - Modal dialogs for fix preview

CLI Extensions:
  - agentready dashboard .  # Launch local web server
  - agentready fix <attribute-id>  # Generate fix for specific attribute
  - agentready create-issue <attribute-id>  # Create GitHub issue
  - agentready create-pr <attribute-id>  # Create draft PR
```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Quick Fixes**
```bash
# User runs assessment
agentready assess . --dashboard

# Opens dashboard in browser at http://localhost:8000
# User clicks "Fix This" on "Missing CLAUDE.md"
# → Creates issue: "Add CLAUDE.md configuration file"
# → Creates draft PR with generated CLAUDE.md template
# → PR includes: project analysis, detected languages, suggested structure
```

**Use Case 2: Batch Remediation**
```bash
# Dashboard shows all failures
# User selects multiple attributes
# Clicks "Fix All Selected"
# → Creates single issue: "Improve AgentReady Score from Silver to Gold"
# → Creates draft PR with all fixes
# → PR description includes before/after score projection
```

**Use Case 3: CI/CD Integration**
```bash
# GitHub Action runs assessment
# Posts comment on PR with assessment results
# Includes links to create remediation issues
# Can auto-create draft PR for improvements
```

**Implementation Approach**:

**Phase 1: Client-Side with gh CLI** (Simplest, no backend needed)
- Use JavaScript in HTML report to call gh CLI via local proxy
- Generate fix files locally
- Use `gh issue create` and `gh pr create`
- Works for users with gh CLI installed

**Phase 2: Dashboard Server** (Enhanced UX)
- Flask/FastAPI server serving dashboard
- WebSocket for live updates
- GitHub OAuth for authentication
- Background workers for fix generation

**Phase 3: Cloud Service** (SaaS offering)
- Hosted dashboard at agentready.dev
- GitHub App installation
- Webhook integration for continuous monitoring
- Team collaboration features

**Fix Templates by Attribute**:

```yaml
claude_md_file:
  type: template
  generates:
    - file: CLAUDE.md
      content: |
        # {repository_name}

        ## Overview
        {auto_generated_description}

        ## Architecture
        {detected_patterns}

        ## Development
        {build_commands}

lock_files:
  type: command
  commands:
    - condition: has_package_json
      run: npm install
    - condition: has_pyproject_toml
      run: poetry lock || pip freeze > requirements.txt

precommit_hooks:
  type: template
  generates:
    - file: .pre-commit-config.yaml
      content: {language_specific_hooks}

readme_structure:
  type: enhancement
  modifies: README.md
  adds_sections:
    - Installation
    - Usage
    - Development
    - Contributing

type_annotations:
  type: ai_powered
  uses: ast_analysis + llm
  modifies: "*.py"
  adds: type_hints
```

**Dashboard vs Report Decision**:

**Keep Both**:
- Static reports for CI/CD, documentation, archiving
- Dashboard for interactive development workflow
- Reports can link to dashboard for remediation
- Dashboard can export static reports

**Benefits of Dashboard**:
- ✅ Interactive remediation workflow
- ✅ Live assessment updates
- ✅ Progress tracking over time
- ✅ Team collaboration (comments, assignments)
- ✅ Automated fix preview before applying
- ✅ Integration with existing tools (GitHub, IDEs)

**Challenges**:
- Authentication complexity (GitHub OAuth)
- Fix generation quality (need good templates + AI)
- PR review overhead (lots of automated PRs)
- Maintaining fix templates as best practices evolve

**Recommended Approach**:

1. **Start with enhanced static report**:
   - Add "Create Issue" buttons that generate gh CLI commands
   - Users copy/paste commands to create issues
   - Include fix templates in issue descriptions

2. **Add local dashboard** (Phase 2):
   - Flask server with WebSocket updates
   - GitHub integration via gh CLI
   - Generate fixes, preview diffs, create PRs

3. **Consider hosted service** (Phase 3+):
   - If adoption is high
   - SaaS model for teams
   - Continuous monitoring and recommendations

**Related**: GitHub integration, automation, remediation, UX

**Notes**:
- This is a MAJOR feature that could become a standalone product
- Consider MVP: "Copy this gh command" buttons in HTML report
- AI-powered fix generation requires careful validation
- Some fixes (like refactoring) need human review
- Could integrate with existing tools (Dependabot, Renovate)
- May want to partner with GitHub for official integration

### GitHub App Integration (Badge & Status Checks)

**Priority**: P2 (High Value)

**Description**: Create a GitHub App that provides badge integration, PR status checks, and automated assessment comments to help Red Hat engineering teams track and improve repository quality.

**Core Features**:

1. **Repository Badge**
   - Shields.io-compatible SVG badge showing certification level
   - Endpoint: `https://agentready.redhat.com/badge/{owner}/{repo}.svg`
   - Dynamic color based on certification (Platinum=purple, Gold=yellow, Silver=silver, Bronze=brown)
   - Include score: "AgentReady: 85.2 (Gold)"
   - Click badge to view latest assessment report

2. **GitHub Actions Integration**
   - Create official `agentready/assess-action` GitHub Action
   - Run assessment on PR events (opened, synchronized, reopened)
   - Run assessment on push to main/master
   - Support custom triggers via workflow_dispatch

3. **PR Status Checks**
   - Use GitHub Commit Status API to report assessment results
   - Set check status: success (>90), warning (75-89), failure (<75)
   - Configurable thresholds via `.agentready-config.yaml`
   - Block PR merge if score below threshold (optional)
   - Link to detailed HTML report in check details

4. **PR Comments**
   - Automated bot comments on PRs with assessment summary
   - Show score delta: "Score changed: 72.4 → 78.3 (+5.9)"
   - List new failures and fixes
   - Collapsible sections for full findings
   - Trend chart showing last 10 assessments (ASCII or embedded image)
   - Include remediation suggestions for new failures

**Technical Implementation**:

**Phase 1: GitHub Actions Integration**
```yaml
# .github/workflows/agentready.yml
name: AgentReady Assessment
on:
  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]
  push:
    branches: [main, master]

jobs:
  assess:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - uses: agentready/assess-action@v1
        with:
          threshold: 75
          post-comment: true
          update-status: true
```

**Phase 2: Badge Service**
```python
# FastAPI endpoint for badge generation
@app.get("/badge/{owner}/{repo}.svg")
async def get_badge(owner: str, repo: str):
    # Fetch latest assessment from GitHub Actions artifacts
    # Or run quick assessment on-demand
    score, level = get_latest_assessment(owner, repo)
    color = LEVEL_COLORS[level]
    return SVGResponse(generate_badge(score, level, color))
```

**Phase 3: GitHub App**
- App permissions: Contents (read), Checks (write), Pull requests (write)
- Webhook events: push, pull_request
- Installed via GitHub Marketplace (Red Hat internal)
- Dashboard at agentready.redhat.com showing:
  - Repository list with scores
  - Historical trends
  - Organization-wide statistics
  - Top repositories by improvement

**Integration Points**:

1. **GitHub Actions Artifacts**
   - Store assessment reports as workflow artifacts
   - Keep last 30 days of reports for trend analysis
   - Generate downloadable HTML/JSON/Markdown reports

2. **GitHub Status API**
   ```python
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/statuses/{commit_sha}
   {
     "state": "success",  # or "pending", "failure", "error"
     "target_url": "https://agentready.redhat.com/reports/{run_id}",
     "description": "AgentReady: 85.2 (Gold)",
     "context": "agentready/assessment"
   }
   ```

3. **GitHub Checks API** (preferred over Status API)
   ```python
   POST /repos/{owner}/{repo}/check-runs
   {
     "name": "AgentReady Assessment",
     "status": "completed",
     "conclusion": "success",
     "output": {
       "title": "Score: 85.2/100 (Gold)",
       "summary": "Passed 20/25 attributes",
       "text": "Detailed findings..."
     }
   }
   ```

**Use Cases**:

**Use Case 1: Add Badge to README**
```markdown
# My Project

[![AgentReady](https://agentready.redhat.com/badge/redhat/my-project.svg)](https://agentready.redhat.com/reports/redhat/my-project)
```

**Use Case 2: Enforce Quality Gates**
```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml
github:
  status_checks:
    enabled: true
    min_score: 75  # Block merge if score < 75
    require_improvement: true  # Block if score decreased
```

**Use Case 3: Track Organization Progress**
- Dashboard shows all repos in Red Hat org
- Filter by team, language, certification level
- Identify repos needing attention
- Celebrate improvements (score increases)

**Configuration**:

```yaml
# .agentready-config.yaml
github:
  badge:
    enabled: true
    style: flat-square  # or flat, plastic, for-the-badge
    label: "AgentReady"

  actions:
    enabled: true
    trigger_on: [pull_request, push]
    post_comment: true
    update_status: true
    upload_artifacts: true

  status_checks:
    enabled: true
    min_score: 75
    require_improvement: false

  comments:
    enabled: true
    show_delta: true
    show_trend: true
    collapse_details: true
```

**Implementation Checklist**:
