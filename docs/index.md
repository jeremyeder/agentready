## Why AgentReady?

AI-assisted development tools like Claude Code, GitHub Copilot, and Cursor AI work best with well-structured, documented codebases. AgentReady **builds the infrastructure** you need and **continuously assesses** your repository across **25 research-backed attributes** to ensure lasting AI effectiveness.

### Four Powerful Workflows

<div class="feature-grid">
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>⚡ Bootstrap (Automated Setup)</h3>
    <p><strong>One command to complete infrastructure.</strong> Generates GitHub Actions workflows, pre-commit hooks, issue/PR templates, Dependabot config, and development standards tailored to your language.</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> New projects, repositories missing automation, or when you want instant best practices.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>📊 Assess (Diagnostic Analysis)</h3>
    <p><strong>Deep analysis of 25 attributes.</strong> Evaluates documentation, code quality, testing, structure, and security. Provides actionable remediation guidance with specific tools and commands.</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Understanding current state, one-time diagnostics, or pre-commit validation.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>🔧 Align (Automated Remediation)</h3>
    <p><strong>Automatically fix infrastructure gaps.</strong> Creates missing files (CLAUDE.md, README), configures pre-commit hooks, updates .gitignore, and establishes foundations that make AI agents immediately effective.</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> After assessment, to automatically establish baseline agent-ready infrastructure without manual work.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="feature">
    <h3>📈 Monitor (Continuous Quality)</h3>
    <p><strong>Runs assess automatically in CI/CD.</strong> Posts PR comments, tracks codebase quality over time, fails builds on infrastructure regressions, and maintains agent effectiveness gates.</p>
    <p><strong>When to use:</strong> After bootstrap, runs automatically on every PR and push to main branch.</p>
  </div>
</div>

## Quick Start

### Bootstrap-First Workflow (Recommended)

```bash
# Install AgentReady
pip install agentready

# Bootstrap your repository (generates all infrastructure)
cd /path/to/your/repo
agentready bootstrap .

# Review generated files
ls -la .github/workflows/
cat .pre-commit-config.yaml

# Commit and push
git add .
git commit -m "build: Bootstrap agent-ready infrastructure"
git push

# Assessment runs automatically on next PR!
```

**What you get in <60 seconds:** GitHub Actions workflows (tests, security, assessment), pre-commit hooks (language-specific formatters/linters), issue & PR templates, Dependabot automation, contributing guidelines, and automatic AgentReady assessment on every PR.

### Align Workflow (Automated Remediation)

```bash
# Assess first to identify gaps
agentready assess .

# Automatically apply fixes
agentready align --dry-run .  # Preview changes first
agentready align .            # Apply fixes

# Re-assess to validate improvements
agentready assess .
```

**What align fixes:** Creates CLAUDE.md for project context, creates/updates README.md for clear entry points, adds pre-commit hooks to prevent broken commits, updates .gitignore to reduce noise, creates .gitattributes for consistency, and establishes foundations that make agents immediately more effective.

### Manual Assessment Workflow

```bash
# Run one-time assessment without infrastructure changes
agentready assess .

# View interactive HTML report
open .agentready/report-latest.html
```

**Assessment output:** Overall score and certification level, detailed findings for 25 attributes, specific remediation steps with tools and examples, three report formats (HTML, Markdown, JSON).

### CI/CD Integration (Headless Mode)

```yaml
# GitHub Actions workflow (auto-generated by bootstrap)
name: AgentReady Assessment
on: [pull_request, push]
jobs:
  assess:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v4
      - name: Install AgentReady
        run: pip install agentready
      - name: Run Assessment
        run: agentready assess . --verbose
      - name: Upload Reports
        uses: actions/upload-artifact@v4
        with:
          name: agentready-reports
          path: .agentready/
      - name: Comment PR
        run: gh pr comment ${{ github.event.number }} --body-file .agentready/report-latest.md
```

**CI/CD benefits:** Automated quality gates on every PR, infrastructure regression detection (fail if foundations degrade), historical tracking with artifacts, automatic PR comments with results, zero manual intervention.

**AgentReady itself scores 80.0/100 (Gold)** — see our [self-assessment report](examples.html#agentready-self-assessment).

## What Gets Assessed?

AgentReady evaluates 25 attributes organized into four weighted tiers. **Tier 1 (50% of score)** covers the fundamentals enabling basic AI agent functionality: CLAUDE.md file for project context, README structure as documentation entry point, type annotations for code understanding, standard project layout for predictability, and lock files for reproducible dependencies.

**Tier 2 (30% of score)** provides major quality improvements and safety nets: test coverage for confident refactoring, pre-commit hooks for quality enforcement, conventional commits for structured history, gitignore completeness for clean navigation, and one-command setup for easy reproduction.

**Tier 3 (15% of score)** delivers significant improvements in specific areas: cyclomatic complexity metrics, structured logging for debugging, API documentation specs, architecture decision records, and semantic naming conventions.

**Tier 4 (5% of score)** handles refinement and optimization: security scanning, performance benchmarks, code smell elimination, PR/issue templates, and container setup.

## Report Formats

AgentReady generates three complementary formats. **Interactive HTML** provides color-coded findings, search/filter/sort capabilities, collapsible sections, and works offline—ideal for sharing with stakeholders. **Version-Control Markdown** offers GitHub-Flavored format that's git-diffable for tracking progress, with certification ladder and next steps—commit it to track improvements over time. **Machine-Readable JSON** contains complete assessment data with timestamps, metadata, and structured findings—perfect for CI/CD integration and programmatic analysis.

[See example reports →](examples.html)

## Evidence-Based Research

All 25 attributes derive from authoritative sources: Anthropic (Claude Code best practices), Microsoft (Code metrics and Azure DevOps), Google (SRE handbook and style guides), ArXiv (software engineering research), and IEEE/ACM (academic publications on code quality). Every attribute includes specific citations and measurable criteria—no subjective opinions, just proven practices.

## What The AI Bubble Taught Us

> "Fired all our junior developers because 'AI can code now,' then spent $2M on GitHub Copilot Enterprise only to discover it works better with... documentation? And tests? Turns out you can't replace humans with spicy autocomplete and vibes."
> — *CTO, Currently Rehiring*

> "My AI coding assistant told me it was 'very confident' about a solution that would have deleted production. Running AgentReady revealed our codebase has the readability of a ransom note. The AI was confident because it had no idea what it was doing. Just like us!"
> — *Senior Developer, Trust Issues Intensifying*

> "We added 'AI-driven development' to the Series B deck before checking if our monolith had a README. AgentReady scored us 23/100. The AI couldn't figure out our codebase because *we* couldn't figure out our codebase. Investors were not impressed."
> — *VP Engineering, Learning About README Files The Hard Way*

> "Spent the year at conferences saying 'AI will 10x productivity' while our agents hallucinated imports, invented APIs, and confidently suggested `rm -rf /`. AgentReady showed us we're missing pre-commit hooks, type annotations, and basic self-awareness. The only thing getting 10x'd was our incident rate."
> — *Tech Lead, Reformed Hype Man*

> "Asked ChatGPT to refactor our auth system. It wrote beautiful code that compiled perfectly and had zero relation to our actual database schema. Turns out when you have no CLAUDE.md file, no ADRs, and variable names like `data2_final_FINAL`, even AGI would just be guessing. And AGI doesn't exist yet."
> — *Staff Engineer, Back to Documentation Basics*

> "My manager saw a demo where AI 'wrote an entire app' and asked why I'm still employed. I showed him our AgentReady score of 31/100, explained that missing lock files and zero test coverage make AI as useful as a Magic 8-Ball, and we spent the next quarter actually engineering instead of prompt-debugging. AI didn't replace me. Basic hygiene saved me."
> — *Developer, Still Employed, Surprisingly*
